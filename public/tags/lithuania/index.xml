      <description>The speed limits in Lithuania are 50 km/h (50 mph) in built up areas, 90 km/h (56 mph) outside built up areas, and 130 km/h (86 mph) on motorways&#xA;In Lithuania the motorways and the non motowary main roads are both called A roads and the smaller roads just have numbers.&#xA;I never rode on the motorways in Lithuania so I cannot comment on them. The main roads that I rode on are of a poorer standard than those in the rest of Europe that I have ridden on to date.</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-34&#34;&gt;Day 34&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-34&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I had finished with my coaching I resumed my travels and I headed North to Warsaw. I stayed in a small hotel on the edge of Warsaw for under 30 Euros and I was able to take the metro in to the city centre which I walked about in for a while, I also found that the old town was somewhat touristy but nonetheless quite interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.offthehamsterwheel.co.uk/posts/34-38/01-34.jpg&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;</description>
