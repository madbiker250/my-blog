      <description>The speed limits are as you can see in the picture that I took from the internet as for some strange reason, I never managed to get a photo of me entering Lithuania from Poland.&#xA;In Lithuania the motorways and the non motowary main roads are the A roads and the smaller roads just have numbers.&#xA;I never rode on the motorways so I cannot comment on them. The main roads that I rode on are of a poorer standard than those in the rest of Europe that I have ridden on to date.</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-34&#34;&gt;Day 34&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-34&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I had finished with my coaching I resumed my travels and I headed North to Warsaw. I stayed in a small hotel on the edge of Warsaw for under thirty Euros and was able to take the metro in to the city centre which I walked about in for a while, I also found that the old town was somewhat touristy but nonetheless quite interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://example.org/posts/34-38/01-34.jpg&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;</description>
