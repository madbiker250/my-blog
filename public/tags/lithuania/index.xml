      <description>&lt;p&gt;The speed limits in Lithuania are 50 km/h (50 mph) in built up areas, 90 km/h (56 mph) outside built up areas, and 130 km/h (86 mph) on motorways&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Lithuania the motorways and the non motorway main roads are both called A roads and the smaller roads just have numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I never rode on the motorways in Lithuania so I cannot comment on them. The main roads that I rode on are of a poorer standard than those in the rest of Europe that I have ridden on to date.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-34&#34;&gt;Day 34&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-34&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I had finished with my coaching I resumed my travels and I headed North to Warsaw. I stayed in a small hotel on the edge of Warsaw for under 30 Euros and I was able to take the metro in to the city centre which I walked about in for a while, I also found that the old town was somewhat touristy but nonetheless quite interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/34-38/01-34.jpg&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/34-38/02-34.jpg&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/34-38/03-34.jpg&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-35&#34;&gt;Day 35&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-35&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next morning I set off to do another favour for another friend. I had been told by my fiend that her father had escaped Poland as a boy in the aftermath of WW2 and had then settled in the USA. She had asked me to swing by the village that her father had been born in near to Byzgoszcz and take some photographs for her. Once this mission had been accomplished I headed North to Gdansk where I spent the night in a cheery hostel full of odd characters for under 20 Euros.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
