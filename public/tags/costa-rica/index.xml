      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;costa-rica&#34;&gt;Costa Rica&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#costa-rica&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Costa Rica is a very expensive country when compared to all of the other countries that I have visited in Central America. I had mixed feelings about my time in the country, the Caribbean side is a complete dump but still as expensive as the rest of the country which in parts was also a dump.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Capital city San Jose for example, was pretty grubby and the public parks that I visited in the centre of the city were full of drunks sleeping on the grass or on the park benches, and both parks stank of stale urine. However, the scenery in the country once away from the Capital city was awesome, especially in the coffee growing area of San Marcos that I stayed in, but it was also very expensive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-131&#34;&gt;Day 131&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-131&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I set off from the city of Granada at about 8 o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning and it was hot. I took the NIC-4 South in the direction of the border crossing at Pena Blanca. I stopped after about an hour for some breakfast at a roadside restaurant and then again about 20 miles from the border at a spot where the road ran close to the lake.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/131-133/01-131.jpg&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I arrived at the border at about half past 10 in the morning and as usual I got stopped at the entrance to the border area, I had my passport checked and I was given my customs declaration form to complete. I parked up outside the main building and then went in to start another episode of the border pantomime.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Biking in Costa Rica</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The speed limits in Costa Rica are 40 km/h (25 mph) in built up areas, 60 km/h (37 mph) outside built up areas, 80 km/h (50 mph) on dual carriageways and the toll roads.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of the road signs for the main roads are Green with White writing and the local roads are White with Black writing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main Costa Rican roads are Highway 2 and 34 in the South of the country below the capital San Jose. In the North of the country the main roads are Highway 1 and 35 that both lead to the border with Nicaragua. These are generally in good condition. The condition of the smaller roads is generally good and they appear to be well maintained. There are no motorways in Costa Rica but around San Jose there a couple of toll roads. The English version of the website explaining the toll roads and their costs can be found here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Days 112 to 113 Costa Rica to Nicaragua</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-112&#34;&gt;Day 112&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-112&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst in San Marcos I stayed at a nice hotel which was a little expensive at $40 per night although breakfast was included in that price. However nice it was in San Marcos, I tend to get restless when I am off the bike for too long so on Monday 15th April I set off for the capital city, San Jose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/112-113/01-112.jpg&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The road from San Marcos to San Jose wound up in to the mountains and provided some spectacular views and great riding but too soon it was over and I started to descend towards San Jose.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Days 110 to 111 Costa Rica</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-110&#34;&gt;Day 110&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-110&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spent 3 nights at my accommodation in San Isidro and to be honest there was not much to do in the city and whilst I was there the weather started to turn showery which discouraged me from exploring further on the bike. I used my time to catch up on the usual housekeeping stuff like emails etc. and when eventually it was time to leave I have to say that I was glad to move on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Days 107 to 109 Panama to Costa Rica</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/107-109/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-107&#34;&gt;Day 107&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-107&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I set off from Panama city at just after 6 o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning on Wednesday 3rd of April and my plan was to get to the city of David which lies about 35 miles West of the main border crossing between Panama and Costa Rica. The bike had just recorded 2,000 miles on the odometer the day before and the ride that day was just under 300 miles. The ride itself was pretty non eventful despite the 14 police speed traps that I passed all the way along Highway 1 during it. The 14 police speed traps that I passed were only the ones on the Westbound side of Highway 1, there were at least the same number if not more on the Eastbound side. I eventually arrived at my destination for the night in the city of David at around 3 o&amp;rsquo;clock in the afternoon and I then spent a quite night contemplating whether or not I would be told when I eventually reached the border the following day, if I had the correct documents or not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
