      <description>&lt;p&gt;The speed limits in Ecuador are 40 km/h (25 mph) or 60 km/h (37 mph) in built up areas, outside built up areas all roads are limited to 90 km/h (56 mph)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of the road signs for the main roads are Green with White writing and the local roads are also Green with White writing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main roads in Ecuador are either tarmac or concrete and they are all very good and reasonably well maintained. There are older stretches of roads in the the more remote areas of the country and the condition of these can be patchy. Most of the roads in Ecuador are toll roads and every one that I used cost me the same price of 20 US Cents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Day 147 Ecuador to Peru</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-147&#34;&gt;Day 147&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-147&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I left Huaquillas and headed back out of town to take the road to the vehicular border crossing. When I arrived at the Ecuadorian side of the border crossing I found that only the customs were located there so I headed in to the office to have my TIP cancelled. This was done very quickly at not cost. Ten minutes later I rode the 4 miles or so over the International bridge to the Peruvian side of the border where I parked the bike and went to find the Peruvian immigration office.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Days 145 to 146 Quito to Huaquillas</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-145&#34;&gt;Day 145&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-145&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I left Quito early and it was cold. The road out of the city climbed and climbed and at one point I got a break in the clouds from where I could take a photo of the city below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/145-146/01-145.jpg&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However just after I set off again I was back in to the clouds and climbing again. Once on the descent I encountered a road accident in the fast lane where a car had stuffed itself under the back of a bus in the heavy fog. The diesel tank of the bus had ruptured and it was running down the road but luckily for me the road was so steep that it all ran straight downhill in the outside lane and it did not flow across the road in to the inside lane.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Day 144 Colombia to Ecuador</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-144&#34;&gt;Day 144&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-144&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was overcast when I left my hotel in San Juan and headed for the border. I arrived there at about half past eight in the morning and it was busy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/144/13-144.jpg&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I parked the bike outside the immigration and customs building and I was immediately approached by a guy who wanted to change my Colombian pesos for USD which they use in Ecuador. The guy gave me a competitive rate so I changed what I had and then he offered to watch my bike for me whilst I went to immigration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
