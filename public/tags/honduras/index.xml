      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-121&#34;&gt;Day 121&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-121&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was another hot day in Honduras, when I set off from Puerto Cortes at 7 o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning it was already displaying 33 degrees Celsius on my bike. I headed for the Guatemalan border that was about an hour away and as the road passed close to the coast I stopped to take a photograph.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.offthehamsterwheel.co.uk/posts/121-122/01-121.jpg&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-119&#34;&gt;Day 119&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-119&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;During my stay in Managua I managed to obtain 2 new electrical relays for the bike which should now hopefully put an end to the starting issue I experienced a few days earlier. One other thing that I needed to attend to was that after my escapades with the punctures, when the bike was in the back of the truck full of sand, somehow or other a load of sand had gotten inside of my petrol tank via the filler cap. Thankfully it was in the overflow drain and not actually inside the tank with the petrol.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.offthehamsterwheel.co.uk/posts/119-120/01-120.jpg&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;</description>
