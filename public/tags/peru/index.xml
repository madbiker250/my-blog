      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-147&#34;&gt;Day 147&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-147&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I left Huaquillas and headed back out of town to take the road to the vehicular border crossing. When I arrived at the Ecuadorian side of the border crossing I found that only the customs were located there so I headed in to the office to have my TIP cancelled. This was done very quickly at not cost. Ten minutes later I rode the 4 miles or so over the International bridge to the Peruvian side of the border where I parked the bike and went to find the Peruvian immigration office.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-148&#34;&gt;Day 148&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-148&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I set of from Chiclayo at about seven oâ€™clock in the morning and I headed South on the main road out of the city. After a couple of hours on the road I stopped in the city of Trujillo to have some breakfast and to put on an extra layer as once again there was a strong cool wind. This time it was blowing some mist in from the sea. On my way out of the city after breakfast I stopped to photograph another example of the appalling litter problem. It was so bad that even as I was riding I could smell the stench of decaying something or other every time I passed something like this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
