      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-99&#34;&gt;Day 99&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-99&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday 11 February I headed off from the hotel in Panama city where I had been staying, North in the direction of Colon. In an earlier post I had visited Colon and found it not to my liking however, I was following a recommendation that I had received to visit the beaches to the East of the city. So as I approached the city I took a small road along the Caribbean coast to the East and headed for the town of Portobello where I had booked in to a hostel for 4 nights.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I rode the bike to the City of Colon on the Caribbean side of the isthmus of Panama to get some miles done to help the engine break in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.offthehamsterwheel.co.uk/posts/out-and-about/01-ri.jpg&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-americas---getting-started&#34;&gt;The Americas - Getting Started&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#the-americas---getting-started&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am now in Panama and I am preparing to continue my RTW trip from here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.offthehamsterwheel.co.uk/posts/part-two/01-ct.jpg&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have bought a new Himalayan from the local dealer here and as it only had 2 kilometres on the clock, I had to begin the process of breaking the engine in. So in real terms that means keeping the engine speeds below 3,000 RPM for the first 300 miles (500 km) which translates in to a top speed of 40 mph (60 kph)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
