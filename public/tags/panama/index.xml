      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;getting-ready-for-south-america&#34;&gt;Getting Ready For South America&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#getting-ready-for-south-america&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the time had come for me to stop loitering about Panama City like a bad smell and get myself and the bike to Colombia to start the South American part of my trip. It is now turning Summer in South America and I wanted to reach Tierra Del Fuego during the good weather window between the start of January and the end of March so it was time to get my arse in gear and get things moving.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Days 131 to 133 Nicaragua and Costa Rica to Panama</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-131&#34;&gt;Day 131&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-131&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I set off from the city of Granada at about 8 o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning and it was hot. I took the NIC-4 South in the direction of the border crossing at Pena Blanca. I stopped after about an hour for some breakfast at a roadside restaurant and then again about 20 miles from the border at a spot where the road ran close to the lake.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/131-133/01-131.jpg&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I arrived at the border at about half past 10 in the morning and as usual I got stopped at the entrance to the border area, I had my passport checked and I was given my customs declaration form to complete. I parked up outside the main building and then went in to start another episode of the border pantomime.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Days 107 to 109 Panama to Costa Rica</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-107&#34;&gt;Day 107&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-107&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I set off from Panama city at just after 6 o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning on Wednesday 3rd of April and my plan was to get to the city of David which lies about 35 miles West of the main border crossing between Panama and Costa Rica. The bike had just recorded 2,000 miles on the odometer the day before and the ride that day was just under 300 miles. The ride itself was pretty non eventful despite the 14 police speed traps that I passed all the way along Highway 1 during it. The 14 police speed traps that I passed were only the ones on the Westbound side of Highway 1, there were at least the same number if not more on the Eastbound side. I eventually arrived at my destination for the night in the city of David at around 3 o&amp;rsquo;clock in the afternoon and I then spent a quite night contemplating whether or not I would be told when I eventually reached the border the following day, if I had the correct documents or not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Biking in Panama</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The speed limits in Panama are 40 km/h (25 mph) in built up areas, 60 km/h (37 mph) outside built up areas, 80 km/h (50 mph) on dual carriageways and 100 km/h (62 mph) on certain sections of dual carriageways and Toll motorways.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Panama there are only 3 Toll motorways. They are all in and around Panama city. The first 2 are the South Corridor and the North Corridor which form a ring road around Panama city. The 3rd is a road that joins the North Corridor road and goes to city of Colon at the Caribbean end of the Panama canal and this is also a toll road.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Days 104 to 106 Panama Part 4 </title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-104&#34;&gt;Day 104&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-104&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;On leaving my jungle accommodation I had a short 20 or so mile ride to the border. On the way back to the main road I stopped at a bridge over the river and took a couple of photos of the crossing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/104-106/19-101.jpg&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/104-106/20-101.jpg&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I got near to the border I pulled in to a petrol station to refuel as I had heard that the price of petrol in Costa Rica is much more expensive that it is in Panama. I eventually reached the border crossing at 10 oâ€™clock in the morning and riding up on to the bridge where the actual border crossing is located, I was stopped by two customs officers and two guys in camouflage uniforms with a drugs dog. After a short conversation I was told to go to the immigration building and then to go the customs building, in that order, which were in the town next to the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Day 103 Panama Part 3</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/103/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-103&#34;&gt;Day 103&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-103&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The road to Boquette ends shortly after the Northern edge of the town and it is in effect a dead end, so to leave it there is no alternative but to retrace your steps back down Highway 41 in the direction of the city of David. So setting off South out of Boquette my plan was to head up to the Caribbean side of Panama and cross the border in to Costa Rica at the town of Guabito. Just out of Boquette I took Highway 10 to Gualaca and then headed North to the Caribbean coast. The road here was quite good except for the odd deep pothole or two and the views were also quite good of the volcano in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-101&#34;&gt;Day 101&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-101&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a few days in Las Tablas I set off South on Highway 2 to explore the peninsula. I rode along the South coast of the peninsula and then I headed North to Macaracas and then on to Highway 50 where I eventually re-joined the main road, Highway 1. To be honest there was very little of interest to see in the peninsula except for signs of land being cleared for future developments, presumably to exploit the Southern coastline for tourists.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Days 99 to 100 Panama Part 1</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-99&#34;&gt;Day 99&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-99&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday 11 February I headed off from the hotel in Panama city where I had been staying, North in the direction of Colon. In an earlier post I had visited Colon and found it not to my liking however, I was following a recommendation that I had received to visit the beaches to the East of the city. So as I approached the city I took a small road along the Caribbean coast to the East and headed for the town of Portobello where I had booked in to a hostel for 4 nights.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I rode the bike to the City of Colon on the Caribbean side of the isthmus of Panama to get some miles done to help the engine break in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/out-and-about/01-ri.jpg&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-americas---getting-started&#34;&gt;The Americas - Getting Started&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#the-americas---getting-started&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am now in Panama and I am preparing to continue my RTW trip from here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/part-two/01-ct.jpg&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have bought a new Himalayan from the local dealer here and as it only had 2 kilometres on the clock, I had to begin the process of breaking the engine in. So in real terms that means keeping the engine speeds below 3,000 RPM for the first 300 miles (500 km) which translates in to a top speed of 40 mph (60 kph)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
