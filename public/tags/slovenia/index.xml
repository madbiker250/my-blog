      <description>The speed limits are as you can see in the picture that I took from the internet.&#xA;In Slovenia the motorways are numbered and prefixed with the letter A, the non motoway main roads are numbered, the smaller roads have the name of the place that the road lead to on them.&#xA;The Slovenian motorways and the non motorway main roads that I rode on are of a good standard, the condition of the smaller roads are generally good but there is always the odd exception.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On 16th April 2019 I left the home of my friend in Galicia for Poland where I intended to keep myself busy for a few months doing some coaching.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Usually, when going from A to B I would take the fastest route, however, on this trip I wanted to try some alternatives to the fast but expensive toll motorways that are the norm in most of Europe now and see if I could still maintain some sort of schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I started off by crossing Spain, passing the cites of Leon, Burgos and Soria using the extensive network of N class roads that exist as an alternative to the motorways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
