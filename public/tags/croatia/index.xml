      <description>The speed limits in Croatia are 50 km/h (31 mph) in built up areas, 90 km/h (56 mph) outside built up areas, and 130 km/h (81 mph) on motorways.&#xA;In Croatia the motorways are numbered and prefixed with the letter A, the non motoway main roads are numbered, the smaller roads have the name of the place that the road lead to on them.&#xA;The Croatian motorways and the non motorway main roads that I rode on are of a good standard, the condition of the smaller roads are generally good but there is always the odd exception.</description>
