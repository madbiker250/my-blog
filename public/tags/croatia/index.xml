      <description>The speed limits are as you can see in the picture that I took from the internet.&#xA;In Croatia the motorways are numbered and prefixed with the letter A, the non motoway main roads are numbered, the smaller roads have the name of the place that the road lead to on them.&#xA;The Croatian motorways and the non motorway main roads that I rode on are of a good standard, the condition of the smaller roads are generally good but there is always the odd exception.</description>
