      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-65&#34;&gt;Day 65&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-65&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the main reasons for leaving Turkey was because all of the land routes to the East from Turkey were closed and because of this I had to decide where to go for the winter. Staying in Turkey was an option but having a 90 day limit to my stay would have meant having to leave Turkey at the end of January to go back a European country. Another factor for consideration was the potential for the alleged virus to affect border crossings at the end of January in to February. As the borders were still open at that time I decided that it would be better to make that journey in early November rather than at the beginning of February.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I left KÄ±rklareli early the next day and headed for the Bulgarian border. On approaching the border the road rose sharply and in the shaded parts, the road was covered in frost. A few minutes at the border and I was once again in Bulgaria. I rode along the coast past Burgas and Varna, I only stopped for fuel and coffee as it was not warming up and it had become overcatst and I was at the Romanian border by late afternoon. Once through I headed for the unremarkable city of Constanta where I spent the night.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The speed limits are as you can see in the picture that I took from the internet.&#xA;In Romania the motorways A roads, the non motoway main roads are just numbered and the smaller roads just have numbers.&#xA;I never rode on the motorways and the non motorway main roads in Romaina that I rode on are of a good standard. The smaller roads were not maintained to the same standard.</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-39&#34;&gt;Day 39&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-39&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day I head off South from my hotel in Kompachy in the direction of Hungary and at about midday I get to a small border crossing, as expexted there is no one on the slovakian side but I am surprised to see that there are two guards carrying AK47&amp;rsquo;s on the Hungarian side.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I drive towards them I get stopped by the guards and they ask for my passport. They give it back to me and then hand me a form that they have just filled out. As I don not read Hungarian I ask what it is and they tell me it is permission to enter and leave the country so I put it in my passport, thank them and ride on to Budapest where I had booked accommodation for two nights.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://example.org/posts/39-42/01-39.jpg&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;</description>
