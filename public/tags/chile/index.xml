      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-154&#34;&gt;Day 154&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-154&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I set off early and I climbed back out of Iqieque and back on to Route 5 South where I refuelled shorty after re-joining it. I was in for yet another 150 mile stretch of empty road before I would get to the next petrol station. It was cold but at least it was sunny and there were no head winds. I had done about 80 miles when I encountered another customs checkpoint in the middle of nowhere. There was a large bus stopped in it and all of the passengers had to disembark and have their bags and documents checked.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-153&#34;&gt;Day 153&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-153&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I arrived at the the border at around half past seven in the morning and it was relatively quiet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/153/01-153.jpg&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The border post was a joint operation between Peru and Chile but there were no signs to indicate which were the immigration windows or which were the customs windows. However after a bit of messing about I eventually found the Peruvian immigration window and got stamped out of Peru but I had to complete a small form in duplicate with my bike details on it and this also got stamped.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
