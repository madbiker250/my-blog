      <title>Days 79 to 81 Poland and Slovakia to Hungary</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-79&#34;&gt;Day 79&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-79&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the world is still mad and borders are still shut because of the alleged virus, or wars, or other political nonsense, and all roads East from Central Europe are still closed. So, its on the merry go round once again and back to Spain to visit my friend. However, this time the Balkans are open for business (well apart from Kosovo and Serbia going at it again!) so I decided to take the opportunity to visit these countries whilst I can. Therefore on 15th August 2022 I headed South from Krakow and took the road from there to the Southern Polish city of Bielsko-Biala. I had never actually been here before so this was a perfect time for a visit and I found it to be quite surprising. The town was obviously fortified at some time and the nicer part of the town is to be found within these walls.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Days 74 to 78 Spain, France, Italy, Austria and Slovakia to Poland</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-74&#34;&gt;Day 74&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-74&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;As those who read this blog are aware of my travels, like those of many others, have been restricted by measures brought in by Governments around the world. Until now such measures have had little direct impact on my travels other than not being able to head East out of Europe. On this journey these measures directly impacted me and my ability to travel as I usually do. The reason that I am writing about this is that as a consequence I made certain choices about my journey that I would perhaps not otherwise have made. I want to make it clear that I am not writing about this to start a discussion about these matters as I do not think that this is an appropriate place to do so, but solely to tell my story about what happened on my trip and why I made certain choices about my travels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Some countries are demanding that people who want to enter their country must have taken the experimental gene therapy injection or they must get &amp;ldquo;tested&amp;rdquo; or both. I had now been in Krakow for about 8 months and nothing has changed to the East, all roads are still closed. I needed to get on the bike and start travelling again, if only to obtain a bit of sanity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Four Years Down and the Tatra Mountains</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has now been 4 years since I left the UK on my adventures, however, as I mentioned in my previous post because of all of the madness engendered in politicians in respect of restrictions on individual movement I am unable to travel much and I am presently marking time in Krakow in Poland. I just thought that I would post this update on my stalled RTW trip and to share a few photographs of my jaunts around Southern Poland in to the Tatra Mountains and around Krakow during the last few months of captivity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Krynica Area of Southern Poland&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/four-years-down-tatra-mountains/01-tm.jpg&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;</description>

      <title>Days 68 to 69 Romania, Hungary and Slovakia to Poland</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-68&#34;&gt;Day 68&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-68&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had spent the night in the town of Satu Mare close to the border crossing with Hungary. I had read that Hungary was open for transit only and that Slovakia were testing people at the border for the alleged virus. I expected to encounter lots of ongoing insane procedures and laws being implemented by border officials and the possibility of being turned away at either or both of the borders. The next morning to compound my potential issues it was cold and raining heavily.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-34&#34;&gt;Day 34&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-34&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I had finished with my coaching I resumed my travels and I headed North to Warsaw. I stayed in a small hotel on the edge of Warsaw for under 30 Euros and I was able to take the metro in to the city centre which I walked about in for a while, I also found that the old town was somewhat touristy but nonetheless quite interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/34-38/01-34.jpg&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/34-38/02-34.jpg&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/34-38/03-34.jpg&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-35&#34;&gt;Day 35&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-35&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next morning I set off to do another favour for another friend. I had been told by my fiend that her father had escaped Poland as a boy in the aftermath of WW2 and had then settled in the USA. She had asked me to swing by the village that her father had been born in near to Byzgoszcz and take some photographs for her. Once this mission had been accomplished I headed North to Gdansk where I spent the night in a cheery hostel full of odd characters for under 20 Euros.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Days 32 to 33 Germany and Czech Republic to Poland</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-32&#34;&gt;Day 32&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-32&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I departed from the Gasthof the weather was not great and it started to rain a little. Once again, I stayed off the motorways as much as possible but progress was slow and occasionally to make up some time I was forced to use the Autobahn. As a result these was little to see and even less reason to stop and photograph anything.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I crossed the border in to the Czech Republic in the rain and rode across to the other side of the county but all the while it continued to rain intermittently. I only stopped for petrol and then moved on trying to get to my destination for that day, the city of Brno as quickly as I could. As I arrived in Brno I got caught in a huge thunderstorm and I got thoroughly soaked before reaching my accommodation for the night. Once sorted out, as the rain had passed I walked in to Brno old town and I found it to be quite pleasant, however, the walk in was not quite as nice. There were lots of people hanging around street corners in large groups, mostly men in the twenties and although they never hassled me, I felt a certain tension in the air. In addition, the streets where these groups were congregating were full of litter and graffiti covered almost every wall.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In most cases, the reason for your plans going sideways is usually the actions of another person, and in my case things were no different.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An asshole is an asshole and there is just no other way to say it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Due to the actions of an asshole, my time in Krakow was obviously at an end and it was decision time. Either to leave or to assault the asshole. So early one February morning I packed the bike and got ready to leave.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Biking in Poland</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The speed limits in Poland are 50 km/h (50 mph) in built up areas, 90 km/h (56 mph) outside built up areas, and 130 km/h (86 mph) on motorways&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The motorways are numbered and prefixed with the letter A. Some of the motorways or stretches of a motorway are toll roads but most are not. The main non-motorway roads are also just numbered, and the smaller main roads are also just numbered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Days 9 to 12 France, Italy, Switzerland, Germany and Czech Republic to Poland</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-9&#34;&gt;Day 9&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-9&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next morning I set off along the D133 in the direction of Gap and at last the sun was out, it was warm and the bike was running well. En route to Gap I passed through the town of Grignan which had a large fortress type building dominating the skyline above the town and so I stopped to take a photo.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/9-12/10-six.jpg&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the curious things that I have noticed during my riding through France is that the road numbers can suddenly change without warning. For example the D133 that I started on changed mysteriously after about 10 miles and became the D541. Unless one keeps a close eye on this it can get very confusing. Yes, I know a Sat Nav would make this point irrelevant but that&amp;rsquo;s the way I like to travel. Riding further East towards Gap I could see the mountains start to rise in the distance. It had been several years since I had ridden over any Alpine passes and I was looking forward to it but by now the sun was strong, it was very warm, and the scenery forced me to stop, not only to capture its beauty and grandeur but also to pause and soak it all up over a cup of coffee or two.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Poland to the United Kingdom</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had always known that my Kawasaki ZZR1200 would not be a suitable bike to use on an RTW trip and although I had planned to change it, I had not really decided on what bike that should be nor when I should change it, so in July 2019 I made the decision that the time was now right to change my bike.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As during my RTW trip I necessarily had planned to cover a lot of miles, the fuel that I would use would be a significant part of my daily expenditure, therefore low fuel consumption would be a very important factor in whatever bike that I chose. Ease of maintenance and repair were the next most important factors on my list of requirements, closely followed by being a bike light enough for me to pick up unassisted. After doing a lot of research and reading a lot of reviews I decided that the Royal Enfield Himalayan was the one that I though most suited my needs as an RTW bike. So in August 2019 I decided to return to the UK and to buy one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Spain to Poland</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On 16th April 2019 I left the home of my friend in Galicia for Poland where I intended to keep myself busy for a few months doing some coaching. Usually, when going from A to B I would take the fastest route, however, on this trip I wanted to try some alternatives to the fast but expensive toll motorways that are the norm in most of Europe now and see if I could still maintain some sort of schedule. Therefore, I started off by crossing Spain, passing the cites of Leon, Burgos and Soria using the extensive network of N class roads that exist as an alternative to the motorways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I arrived in the city of Opole about a month ago and I must say that of the little of Poland that I have seen, I like this country. In places Poland reminds me of Scotland as it used to be about 40 years ago and in other places it looks just like any other modern European country.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
