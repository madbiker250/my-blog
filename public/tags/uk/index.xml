      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-1&#34;&gt;Day 1&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;On my newly purchased Royal Enfield Himalayan I left Folkestone to ride the 500 miles or so to Glasgow on the motorways on the East coast of England. Riding this new bike was strange after having powerful large capacity sports touring bikes for the past 20 or so of my life. The Kawasaki ZZR1200 that I had just part-exchanged for the Himalayan produced around 160 brake horse power (BHP) and was restricted to a top speed of 186 mph (290 kph). This bike only produced 24 BHP and I was still to discover what spped it was capable of.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Different as it was from most of my previous bikes, I was enjoying the more upright riding position and the quickness of steering as I found it very easy to change direction without much effort. I rode North on the M20, then around the M25 till I came to the A1 which I then rode North on. I stopped for petrol and coffee after a couple of hours and then suitably refreshed I pushed on. The bike could maintain 70 mph on the motorway without much difficulty but I sensed that this was near to the top end of it&amp;rsquo;s performance and I though that it would feel more comfortable around 60 mph. I continued North on the A1 until I came to the A66 at Scotch Corner where I turned left and planned to head for Penrith and then North to the Scottish border.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.offthehamsterwheel.co.uk/posts/1-2/02-one.jpg&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;</description>

      <title>Departing - Another Rant</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I have updated this blog, a lot has happened to me since my last post so I shall start where I left off. After leaving my bike at the home of my friend in Galicia I flew back to the UK and arrived a Stanstead airport only to find that my flight to Glasgow was delayed by a couple of hours by snow on the runways, however eventually the plane took off and I was Scotland bound once again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I travelled from Glasgow airport to my home the views of Glasgow from the motorway made my heart sink like the Titanic and like it, I hit rock bottom very quickly. On my way hoe I stopped at a large supermarket to get some provisions and was quickly reminded of the lack of common courtesy displayed by most people who shop there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>De-Cluttering of a Life</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The recent dismantling of my present life in preparation for the next part of my life I have found to be an unexpectedly cathartic experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The de-cluttering of a life is something I can now definitely recommend and whether the de-cluttering is solely of unused physical possessions or otherwise is up to you, but it is a process that for me has prompted a realisation that it is perhaps something that I should have done a long time ago. I was surprised at the quantity of items that I possessed for which I had no real use. I may have had a use for them at one time in my life but there they sat in the cupboard, loft, or drawer willing me to hang on to them for just another year, just in caseâ€¦.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reasons For Departure...</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I fully expected that the next post that I made in this blog would be something to do with my bike and how it is now serviced and ready to hurtle off towards the setting sun&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However one of the many reasons as to why I have taken a dislike to this country has just sneaked up and prodded me in the eye. I should know better by now but against my better judgement I had a quick look at the evening news as hosted by the BBC (Biased Broadcasting Corporation) only to be informed that as a result of BREXIT, inflation is on the rise and prices of goods including petrol are expected to rise as a result. I get that, with a weaker pound imported products will cost more, but petrol?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is news to me but according to the upper class twit the BBC produced to explain to the assembled peasantry, the UK apparently buys its oil in US Dollars and since the pound has fallen against the dollar oil is therefore more expensive to buy. Like the argument for imported goods this sounds reasonable unless you are an adult with an IQ over 20, semi-literate, and or live in central Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
