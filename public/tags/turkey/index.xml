      <description>&lt;p&gt;The speed limits in Turkey are 50 km/h (50 mph) in built up areas, 90 km/h (56 mph) outside built up areas, and 120 km/h (74 mph) on motorways.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Turkey the motorways are numbered and prefixed with the letter D, the non motorway main roads are numbered and also prefixed with the letter D, the smaller roads just have the names of the town that they lead to on the signs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Days 65 to 67 Turkey, Bulgaria and Moldovian Border to Romania</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-65&#34;&gt;Day 65&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-65&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the main reasons for leaving Turkey was because all of the land routes to the East from Turkey were closed and because of this I had to decide where to go for the winter. Staying in Turkey was an option but having a 90 day limit to my stay would have meant having to leave Turkey at the end of January to go back a European country. Another factor for consideration was the potential for the alleged virus to affect border crossings at the end of January in to February. As the borders were still open at that time I decided that it would be better to make that journey in early November rather than at the beginning of February. I left KÄ±rklareli early the next day and headed for the Bulgarian border. On approaching the border the road rose sharply and in the shaded parts, the road was covered in frost. A few minutes at the border and I was once again in Bulgaria. I rode along the coast past Burgas and Varna, I only stopped for fuel and coffee as it was not warming up and it had become overcast. I was at the Romanian border by late afternoon and once through I headed for the unremarkable city of Constanta where I spent the night.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-greekroman-city-of-aizanoi&#34;&gt;The Greek/Roman City of Aizanoi&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#the-greekroman-city-of-aizanoi&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This site was one of the best and undeveloped sites that I have yet encountered on my travels. Apart from a partially complete temple, the site had row upon row of stone carvings that were used to decorate the many buildings that used to stand on this site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the most amazing things on this site was a complete underground vault that had survived from when it was originally constructed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/aizanoi/01-az.JPG&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-53&#34;&gt;Day 53&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-53&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/53--55/01-53.jpg&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I arrived at the the Greek and Turkish border under a cloudy sky which looked like it could produce some rain. After the usual rounds of producing my passport and bike ownership documents to the Greek and Turkish border and customs officials, I was almost cleared to enter Turkey. However, I first had to go to one of the buildings at the border and purchase insurance that covered me for riding my bike in Turkey. For the price of about 15 Euros I obtained 90 days cover. Now I was in Turkey and I set off for Isatnbul. The rain was light and came and went and I was getting a bit bored and then I saw this at the side of the road. A Boeing 737 restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
