      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-125&#34;&gt;Day 125&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-125&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I took a few days off in Antigua Guatemala right across the road from my hotel was a bike shop so I took the opportunity to have the guys who ran the shop try to straighten out my rear wheel ABS rotor. As the bike had just turned 5000 miles on the clock I asked them to change the engine oil while they were at it. They straightened the rotor for me but the malfunction on the rear ABS is still there, I will need to buy a new ABS rotor on my return to Panama city.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had planned a short riding day, my destination for the day was Port San Jose on the Pacific coast some 50 miles or so away. I left Antigua Guatemala about 10 o&amp;rsquo;clock in the moring and to be honest ride there was pretty uninspiring because the heat haze was very thick and I could not see very much. I arrived at my destination at about 1 0&amp;rsquo;clock in the afternoon and eventually found my hotel no thanks to Google maps that had me going in circles for about an hour. Once unpacked I got changed and headed out in a 3 wheeled taxi to have a look at the beach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/125-126/01-125.jpg&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;</description>
