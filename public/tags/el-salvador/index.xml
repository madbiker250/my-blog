      <description>Costa RicaCosta Rica is a very expensive country when compared to all of the other countries that I have visited in Central America. I had mixed feelings about my time in the country, the Caribbean side is a complete dump but still as expensive as the rest of the country which in parts was also a dump.&#xA;The Capital city San Jose for example, was pretty grubby and the public parks that I visited in the centre of the city were full of drunks sleeping on the grass or on the park benches, and both parks stank of stale urine.</description>

It took me just about an hour to get to the El Salvadorian Honduran border.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/129-130/01-129.jpg&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-127&#34;&gt;Day 127&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-127&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;After spending 2 nights at my accommodation in Santa Ana it was time to leave. Due to having to return to Panama to attend to some personal business, I have had to cut my Central America trip short. Now having no time to visit Mexico, it was time to start heading South towards Panama but not before taking another couple of days to explore El Salvador.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I left Santa Ana at about 9 &amp;lsquo;o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning heading generally South, and an hour later I had stopped for a coffee high above lake Coatepeque. The view was great except for the heat haze that restricted it somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/127-128/02-127.jpg&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-125&#34;&gt;Day 125&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-125&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I took a few days off in Antigua Guatemala right across the road from my hotel was a bike shop so I took the opportunity to have the guys who ran the shop try to straighten out my rear wheel ABS rotor. As the bike had just turned 5000 miles on the clock I asked them to change the engine oil while they were at it. They told me that they had straightened the rotor for me but the malfunction on the rear ABS is still there, I will probably need to buy a new ABS rotor on my return to Panama city.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had planned a short riding day, my destination for the day was Port San Jose on the Pacific coast some 50 miles or so away. I left Antigua Guatemala about 10 o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning and to be honest ride there was pretty uninspiring because the heat haze was very thick and I could not see very much. I arrived at my destination at about 1 o&amp;rsquo;clock in the afternoon and eventually found my hotel no thanks to Google maps that had me going in circles for about an hour. Once unpacked I got changed and headed out in a 3 wheeled taxi to have a look at the beach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/125-126/01-125.jpg&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;</description>
