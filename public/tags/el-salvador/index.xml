      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;costa-rica&#34;&gt;Costa Rica&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#costa-rica&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Costa Rica is a very expensive country when compared to all of the other countries that I have visited in Central America. I had mixed feelings about my time in the country, the Caribbean side is a complete dump but still as expensive as the rest of the country which in parts was also a dump.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Capital city San Jose for example, was pretty grubby and the public parks that I visited in the centre of the city were full of drunks sleeping on the grass or on the park benches, and both parks stank of stale urine. However, the scenery in the country once away from the Capital city was awesome, especially in the coffee growing area of San Marcos that I stayed in, but it was also very expensive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Days 129 to 130 El Salvador and Honduras to Nicaragua</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-129&#34;&gt;Day 129&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-129&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I left San Miguel at about 6 &amp;lsquo;o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning as I knew that I had 2 borders to cross and I wanted to leave sufficient time to do this and get to a place to stay in Nicaragua before it got dark. It took me just about an hour to get to the El Salvadorian Honduran border.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/129-130/01-129.jpg&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The El Salvadorian side was quick, I had to go to the customs first to get my TIP cancelled. That took all of 5 minutes at no cost. Then I rode about half a mile to the actual border and after my passport was checked I went to immigration. That took 10 minutes to get processed for leaving El Salvador and again at no cost.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The speed limits in El Salvador are 40 km/h (25 mph) or 60 km/h (37 mph) in built up areas, outside built up areas all roads are limited to 80 km/h (50 mph)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of the road signs for the main roads are Green with White writing and the local roads are Blue with White writing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main roads in El Salvador are either tarmac or concrete and they are all generally very good and reasonably well maintained. There are older stretches of roads in the the more remote areas of the country and the condition of these can be patchy but in general much better than in Guatemala.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Days 127 to 128 El Salvador</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-127&#34;&gt;Day 127&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-127&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;After spending 2 nights at my accommodation in Santa Ana it was time to leave. Due to having to return to Panama to attend to some personal business, I have had to cut my Central America trip short. Now having no time to visit Mexico, it was time to start heading South towards Panama but not before taking another couple of days to explore El Salvador.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I left Santa Ana at about 9 &amp;lsquo;o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning heading generally South, and an hour later I had stopped for a coffee high above lake Coatepeque. The view was great except for the heat haze that restricted it somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Days 125 to 126 Guatemala to El Salvador</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-125&#34;&gt;Day 125&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-125&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I took a few days off in Antigua Guatemala right across the road from my hotel was a bike shop so I took the opportunity to have the guys who ran the shop try to straighten out my rear wheel ABS rotor. As the bike had just turned 5000 miles on the clock I asked them to change the engine oil while they were at it. They told me that they had straightened the rotor for me but the malfunction on the rear ABS is still there, I will probably need to buy a new ABS rotor on my return to Panama city.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
