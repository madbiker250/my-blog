      <description>The speed limits in Greece are 50 km/h (50 mph) in built up areas, 90 km/h (56 mph) outside built up areas, and 130 km/h (86 mph) on motorways.&#xA;In Greece the motorways are just numbered, the non motorway main roads are just numbered and the smaller roads just have the names of the town that they lead to on the signs.&#xA;The Greek motorways and the non motorway main roads that I rode on are of a good standard, however service stations were few and far between.</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-47&#34;&gt;Day 47&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-47&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to the madness I had to pre book my accommodation in Greece and pass the details to the Greek government before entry, therefore once I entered Greece I had to get from the border crossing to the port of Igoumenitsa on the West of Greece to cross over to the island of Corfu and because I was travelling a large distance to catch a ferry, a full day on the Greek motorways and an early start was required. It was still dark when I loaded up the bike and set off for the border.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
