      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;costa-rica&#34;&gt;Costa Rica&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#costa-rica&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Costa Rica is a very expensive country when compared to all of the other countries that I have visited in Central America. I had mixed feelings about my time in the country, the Caribbean side is a complete dump but still as expensive as the rest of the country which in parts was also a dump.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Capital city San Jose for example, was pretty grubby and the public parks that I visited in the centre of the city were full of drunks sleeping on the grass or on the park benches, and both parks stank of stale urine. However, the scenery in the country once away from the Capital city was awesome, especially in the coffee growing area of San Marcos that I stayed in, but it was also very expensive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Biking in Guatemala</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The speed limits in Guatemala are 40 km/h (25 mph) or 60 km/h (37 mph) in built up areas, outside built up areas all roads are limited to 80 km/h (50 mph)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of the road signs for the main roads are Green with White writing and the local roads are Blue with White writing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main roads in Guatemla are either tarmac or concrete and they are all generally very good and reasonably well maintained. There are older stretches of roads in the the more remote areas of the country and the condition of these can be patchy ranging from good to badly broken and potholed surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Days 125 to 126 Guatemala to El Salvador</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-125&#34;&gt;Day 125&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-125&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I took a few days off in Antigua Guatemala right across the road from my hotel was a bike shop so I took the opportunity to have the guys who ran the shop try to straighten out my rear wheel ABS rotor. As the bike had just turned 5000 miles on the clock I asked them to change the engine oil while they were at it. They told me that they had straightened the rotor for me but the malfunction on the rear ABS is still there, I will probably need to buy a new ABS rotor on my return to Panama city.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Days 123 to 124 Guatemala</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-123&#34;&gt;Day 123&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-123&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I left my accommodation in Coban at just after 8 o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning and set off for the city of Huehuetenango which I had decided to ride to that day. Google maps showed that Huehuetenango was just over 120 miles away but the time to do it was show as nearly 5 hours so I knew to expect some slow going in parts of my journey for the day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Days 121 to 122 Honduras to Guatemala</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/121-122/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-121&#34;&gt;Day 121&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-121&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was another hot day in Honduras, when I set off from Puerto Cortes at 7 o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning it was already displaying 33 degrees Celsius on my bike. I headed for the Guatemalan border that was about an hour away and as the road passed close to the coast I stopped to take a photograph.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/121-122/01-121.jpg&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On my arrival at the Honduran side of the border at 8 o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning, as usual I was stopped and asked for my passport. I was then allowed to proceed to the main border building. I had hoped that by arriving at the border early it would be relatively quiet. However, when I parked the bike I saw a huge queue of people standing at the Honduras exit window, apparently everyone else had the same idea as me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
