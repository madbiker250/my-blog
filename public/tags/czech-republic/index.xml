      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-32&#34;&gt;Day 32&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-32&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I departed from the Gasthof the weather was not great and it started to rain a little. Once again, I stayed off the motorways as much as possible but progress was slow and occasionally to make up some time I was forced to use the Autobahn. As a result these was little to see and even less reason to stop and photograph anything.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The speed limits are as you can see in the picture that I again took from the internet as like when I entered Spain, I somehow never managed to get a picture of them.&#xA;The motorways are are just numbered and although they are toll roads they are free for motorbikes, the main non-motorway roads are also just numbered, and the smaller main roads just have road names.&#xA;The motorways signs are in Green, the main road signs are in Blue, and signs for the smaller roads are white.</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-9&#34;&gt;Day 9&lt;a class=&#34;anchorjs-link&#34; href=&#34;#day-9&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next morning I set off along the D133 in the direction of Gap and at last the sun was out, it was warm and the bike was running well. En route to Gap I passed through the town of Grignan which had a large fortress type building dominating the skyline above the town and so I stopped to take a photo.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;https://example.org/posts/9-12/10-six.jpg&#34;/&gt; &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;</description>
