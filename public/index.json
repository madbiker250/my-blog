Riding this new bike was strange after having powerful large capacity sports touring bikes for the past 20 or so of my life.

The bike could maintain 70 mph on the motorway without much difficulty but I sensed that this was near to the top end of it\u0026rsquo;s performance and I though that it would feel more comfortable around 60 mph. I continued North on the A1 until I came to the A66 at Scotch Corner where I turned left and planned to head for Penrith and then North to the Scottish border.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"/posts/1-2/02-one.jpg\"/\u003e \n\u003c/figure\u003e","tags":"uk","title":"Days 1 to 2 August 2019","url":"/posts/1-2/"},{"date":"4 September, 2019","subtitle":"\u003cp\u003eI had always known that my Kawasaki ZZR1200 would not be a suitable bike to use on an RTW trip and although I had planned to change it, I had not really decided on what bike that should be nor when I should change it, so in July 2019 I made the decision that the time was now right to change my bike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs during my RTW trip I necessarily had planned to cover a lot of miles, the fuel that I would use would be a significant part of my daily expenditure, therefore low fuel consumption would be a very important factor in whatever bike that I chose.
