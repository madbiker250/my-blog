      <description>&lt;p&gt;The speed limits in Germany are 50 km/h (50 mph) in built up areas, 90 km/h (56 mph) outside built up areas, and 130 km/h (86 mph) on motorways.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The motorways are are called Autobahns and are just numbered. They are also toll free. The non-motorway main roads are also just numbered, and the smaller roads just have road names.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Certain parts of the Autobahns have no speed limit and when driving on these roads it is very important to take great care when overtaking a slower moving vehicle as some other vehicle may be approaching you at extremely high speed. The best advice that I can give is once you decide to overtake make sure nothing is coming up fast behind you and then once you have made your ovetake get back in to the inside lane as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The speed limits in Spain are 50 km/h (50 mph) in built up areas, 90 km/h (56 mph) outside built up areas, and 130 km/h (86 mph) on motorways.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like France, the motorways are the A roads, the main non-motorway roads are the N roads, and the smaller main roads are the C roads.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The motorways are all of a high standard but some are toll roads and some are not. The toll motorways are the AP numbered motorways and the non-toll motorways are the A numbered motorways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Biking in France</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/series/themes-guide/france/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The speed limits in France are 50 km/h (50 mph) in built up areas, 90 km/h (56 mph) outside built up areas, and 130 km/h (86 mph) on motorways but the 130 kph limit on the motorways is reduced to 110 kph when it is raining.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The motorways are the A roads, the main non-motorway roads are the N roads, and the smaller main roads are the C roads.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The C roads sometimes change their numbers without warning, so for example lets say that you are on the C413, without warning it suddenly becomes say the the C116 (not a real example) I do not know the reason for this however it is worthwhile keeping an eye on this when using these roads to avoid getting lost or confused.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
