        <p>I arrived in the city of Opole about a month ago and I must say that of the little of Poland that I have seen, I like this country. In places Poland reminds me of Scotland as it used to be about 40 years ago and in other places it looks just like any other modern European country.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/posts/poland-2018/01-pol.jpeg"/> 
</figure>

<p>There is no doubt that there is very little money floating around this part of Poland, probably why so many Polish people travel to the UK and Germany to find better paid employment, and this is why some parts of this country remind me of Scotland during the 1970&rsquo;s.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/posts/poland-2018/02-pol.jpeg"/> 
</figure>

<p>I have seen many disused industrial sites, abandoned railway tracks, and expensive cars are a rare sight however, this is contrasted with a modern pedestrianised city centre where those who do have some spare cash hang out to drink coffee or indulge in one of Polish peoples favourite foods, ice cream. There are Lody (ice cream) shops everywhere here and even when it is cold and they are always busy.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/posts/poland-2018/03-pol.jpeg"/> 
</figure>

<p>A couple of weeks ago I travelled to a small town near the Czech border called Bielawa and on my journey there and back I was amazed to find that the countryside around this town looked remarkably like that which is to be found around the English and Scottish border regions. This is the field we played on and I could have sworn I was in Cumbria or Galloway (on a very sunny day)</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/posts/poland-2018/04-pol.jpeg"/> 
</figure>

<p>Another thing about Poland that reminds me of Scotland 40 years ago is the lack of immigrants. I have been here just over a month and I have yet to see one black person or one person who appears to be from the Middle East. Poland will not accept immigration of Africans or those Middle Eastern countries such as Syria. The EU are currently trying to force Poland to take their quota of African and Middle Eastern immigrants but Poland (along with a number of other European countries) have refused and the EU is taking legal action to force them to do so.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/posts/poland-2018/05-pol.jpeg"/> 
</figure>

<p>Having gotten to know and spoken at length with a lot of Polish people over the past month or so, it seems that the general opinion of most Polish people is that having seen what problems such immigration has brought to to other European countries who have taken these immigrants, notably the UK, France, and Germany, they want no part of it. Personally I think they are right to want to keep their country free from such problems, and what I mean by that is &ldquo;When was the last death of a Polish citizen in Poland as a result of a terrorist attack?&rdquo; Mmmm let me think about that one&hellip;.. Oh that&rsquo;s right there has not been one!</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/posts/poland-2018/06-pol.jpeg"/> 
</figure>

<p>If refusing immigration from African and Middle Eastern countries is keeping their citizens from dying in terrorist attacks then I agree with the Polish. I am sick and tired of listening to reports form the UK of yet another terrorist plot foiled by the police and security services, or another report of innocent British citizens being killed in terrorist attacks. If the price of immigration is the death of your citizens at the hands of those who hold beliefs contrary to those held by the majority of your citizens, then perhaps it is time to change your immigration policy, or better still do what Poland is doing, not let them in to your country in the first place.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/posts/poland-2018/07-pol.jpeg"/> 
</figure>

<p>However, I can already hear the howls of dissent and cries of &ldquo;Bigot!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Racist!&rdquo; to this opinion. Social Justice Warriors (SJW&rsquo;s) everywhere must be thinking &ldquo;how dare such people be allowed to hold such non politically correct views, the EU must go in to Poland at once and enforce multiculturalism and immigration on the Polish people whether they want it or not&rdquo;. If you look closely at the news, and by this I mean get your information from several different sources instead of obediently swallowing the multi-culturalist propaganda pushed out by liberal elitist news media outlets such as the BBC or SKY News, you might just see that far from being a utopia filled with rainbows and sunshine, Europe is starting to come apart at the seams. Largely due to the EU policy of unrestrained illegal immigration, the ordinary people (SJW&rsquo;s - please read bigot or racist here) of other European countries are starting to elect governments or politicians who are starting to question such policies.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/posts/poland-2018/08-pol.jpeg"/> 
</figure>

<p>Now having lived in 2 European countries other than the UK in the space of just over 1 year, I have not only been fortunate to have seen what goes on in these countries for myself and not just accept what is pushed at me by the media, but I also have the personal experience of being an immigrant (albeit a temporary one) living in these countries. Therefore in these matters I have a perspective informed by experience rather than just an opinion based on what I have learned from the media or from what I have been told by someone else. Therefore, my perspective and opinions, whether you like them or loathe them, are based on my experience of being an immigrant in Europe.</p>
<p>The Spanish people and the Polish people whom I have met could not have been more welcoming or more friendly towards me and they have all, without exception, told me that they do dot object to immigration in to their countries by people, like me, who share their values and beliefs, but they do not want people who do not share their values or beliefs to come to their countries. Maybe those in power should listen to such people and maybe then they might just remain in power a little bit longer. In my opinion as a UK citizen living as an immigrant in Europe, Brexit has made ordinary Europeans question the EU and everything it stands for. Anti EU change is starting to grow rapidly and the Europhile collectivist political class who dominate the EU, are unable to take their heads out of the money trough are blind to the (metaphorical) firing squads that are starting to assemble in the background.</p>
