        <h1 id="day-123">Day 123<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#day-123"></a></h1><p>I left my accommodation in Coban at just afer 8 o&rsquo;clock in the morning and set off for the city of Huehuetenango which I had decided to ride to that day. Google maps showed that Huehuetenango was just over 120 miles away but the time to do it was show as nearly 5 hours so I knew to expects some slow going in parts on my journey for the day.</p>
<p>Just as I left Coban I saw a really nice roadside  so I pulled in for coffee and some breakfast of steak with scrambled eggs for 35 Quetzals (4.50 US Dollars)</p>

<p>Once suitably fed and watered I set off South on road number CA14 then after a few miles I cut of it and on to road number 7W . This road was amazing, this is what I expected Guatemala to look like, high mountains, deep valleys and twisty roads throughout.</p>

<p>The road surface was perfect for about 50 miles and I was in biker heaven but all good things must come to an end and I hit the older part of the road and this is where the &ldquo;Tumulos&rdquo; started to appear again together with stretches of badly degraded road surface over bridges and at junctions. There were also more than a few massive potholes but I managed to dodge most of these.</p>
<p>Then I encountered another bridge over a river that used metal grid plates for a road surface, now with the knobbly tyres on the bike the very short ride over the bridge was more than a little entertaining as the bike squirmed about like a snake that someone had just stood on!</p>

<p>However, despite the deteriorating road conditions and riding through large towns with no directional signs which caused me to get lost a couple of times, the scenery was superb and once out of the towns I enjoyed the ride through the mountains.</p>

<p>When I arrived in the city of Huehuetenango at about 2 o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon I didn&rsquo;t really like it so I decided to push on to the city of Quetzaltenango which lay just over 60 miles and another 2 hours to the South. Again the road climbed up the sides of the mountains and then dropped down in to the valley below before climbing up the other side of the valley. This process repeated itself a few times before I eventually dropped down in to the valley where the city of Quetzaltenango lay below me.</p>
<p>As I was riding in to the city I noticed that the traffic was getting heavier so when I saw a nice looking hotel as the side of the road I pulled in and inquired about a room for the night. 200 Quetzals (25 US Dollars) for a very nice room and a safe place to park the bike right outside my hotel room door. Once showered and sorted I took an Uber taxi in to the centre of the city and the road in was stuffed full with traffic as was the city centre when I arrived there.</p>
<p>There were a few nice old buildings around a small square but apart from that there was not much else to see, I was so glad to have stopped outside the city centre not having had to ride through such heavy traffic just to have a look at nothing much.</p>

<p>I took a few photos and in one of them you can see the altitude that the city sits at as there was some low cloud sitting in a valley just outside the city.</p>

</figure>

<p>Just after I took the photos I heard the rumble of thunder and a few spots of rain started to fall from the now leaden skies. I sought refuge in a nearby cafe just in time as, like the previous late afternoon, the rain came down with a vengeance. Once I had finished my coffee I got an Uber taxi back to my hotel and I arrived there just as the rain had stopped. I took the opportunity to take a photo of my now washed bike parked at the rear of the hotel.</p>
