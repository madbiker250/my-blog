  <title>Days 24 to 27 Portugal to Spain | OFF THE HAMSTER WHEEL</title>
  <meta name="author" content="The Madbiker">
  <meta name="description" content="Day 24After saying my goodbyes to my friends in Alvor I headed West. Riding along the N125 I passed by Faro and continued until I had to join the motorway to cross the border in to Spain. I then continued on the A49 from the border, circumventing Seville and headed South on the N4 and A381 till I eventually reached Gibraltar.


     


Once there I was disappointed as it was nothing like I had expected it to be and the only positive thing that I have to say about Gibraltar was the price of petrol at only 85 cents per litre. I don&rsquo;t really know what I was expecting but it seemed very cluttered, almost industrial in nature, so after a quick circuit it was back across the border and back in to Spain where I found a reasonable motel room for under 25 Euros for the night.">

<p>Once there I was disappointed as it was nothing like I had expected it to be and the only positive thing that I have to say about Gibraltar was the price of petrol at only 85 cents per litre. I don&rsquo;t really know what I was expecting but it seemed very cluttered, almost industrial in nature, so after a quick circuit it was back across the border and back in to Spain where I found a reasonable motel room for under 25 Euros for the night.</p>
<h1 id="day-25">Day 25<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#day-25"></a></h1><p>The next morning I took the N340 along the coast and passed through the tourist havens of Marbella and Malaga, these towns were not to my liking but I can see why these areas are popular tourist destinations. West of Malaga I got off the main road and hit the smaller roads as I headed up to the city of Granada.</p>

<p>When I arrived in Granada I tried to visit the Alhambra palace but due to the restrictions it was closed, so I took a quick photo of the city from a nearby vantage point and then I headed in to the city where I found a very nice hotel for under 30 Euros and bedded down for the night.</p>

<h1 id="day-26">Day 26<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#day-26"></a></h1><p>The next morning I decided to try and ride up the highest paved road in Europe, the Pico Veleta in the Siera Nevadas, however I found the road to the summit was closed off by a barrier but not to be deterred I took one of the gravel tracks below it and managed to get almost all the way up to the summit before the gravel track joined the forbidden road.</p>

</figure>

<p>As there were a lot of official vehicles on the road I decided not to see if they would call the Spanish cops if I went to the summit, so I turned and trundled back down. After my unsuccessful attempt to get to the top of the Pico Veleta I took a very pleasant ride from Granada up through the National park of Cazorla Segura. As usual away from the motorways the roads were empty and the scenery quite stunning.</p>

<p>I eventually stopped at a large motel near to Requena where I spent the night. It was one of the more expensive rooms that I chose but being very little else available, a room for 50 Euros was all that was on offer.</p>
<h1 id="day-27">Day 27<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#day-27"></a></h1><p>The next day I took the N330 North from Albacete in the direction of Teruel where I saw many abandoned railway stations that used to service a now defunct line that ran parallel to the main road.</p>

<p>Further along the N330 to Teruel I found a small parking place at the side of the road where I could stop to make a coffee and enjoy the peace and quiet of the deserted road in the middle of the Spanish countryside.</p>

<p>A mid afternoon stop in the city of Alcaniz was next on the agenda. There I took a break from the hot afternoon sun by sitting sipping coffee and smoking a cigar in the shade of the Cathedral.</p>

<p>I then resumed my journey Eastwards on the N420 to the city of Reus where I would stay with some friends for a few days but on the way I again had to stop and photograph the amazing scenery.</p>
