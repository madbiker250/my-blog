        <h1 id="day-129">Day 129<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#day-129"></a></h1><p>I left San Miguel at about 6 &lsquo;o&rsquo;clock in the morning as I knew that I had 2 borders to cross and I wanted to leave sufficient time to do this and get to a place to stay in Nicaragua before it got dark. It took me just about an hour to get to the El Salvadorian Honduran border.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/posts/129-130/01-129.jpg"/> 
</figure>

<p>The El Salvadorian side was quick, I had to go to the customs first to get my TIP cancelled. That took all of 5 minutes at no cost. Then I rode about half a mile to the actual border and after my passport was checked I went to immigration. That took 10 minutes to get processed for leaving El Salvador and again at no cost.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/posts/129-130/02-129.jpg"/> 
</figure>

<p>Then I rode over a bridge</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/posts/129-130/03-129.jpg"/> 
</figure>

<p>and I parked up outside the main building on the Honduras side of the bridge.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/posts/129-130/04-129.jpg"/> 
</figure>

<p>I went to immigration. That only took 10 minutes and I got processed for entering Honduras at no cost. Then I headed over to the customs to get my TIP and again I was fleeced by a &ldquo;helper&rdquo; for 50 US Dollars for my TIP but as it took a total of 30 minutes I thought that it was an acceptable cost for the time saved, and by just before 8 o&rsquo;clock I was in Honduras and on my way to the Nicaraguan border about 100 miles away.</p>
<p>I rode from the border crossing at El Amatillo towards Choluteca, it was very overcast but as I reached Choluteca I got caught in some very light rain for about 20 miles or so. By the time I had cleared Choluteca and was on the way to the Honduran Nicaraguan border crossing at El Espino the rain had thankfully stopped.</p>
<p>The road climbed and climbed, up in to the warm clouds, and once over the mountains, as I was dropping down the other side, the sun started to appear. Eventually the extremely long line of parked articulated lorries told me that I was approaching the border crossing.</p>
<p>I got to the Honduran border crossing building at about 10 o&rsquo;clock in the morning and I parked the bike directly outside. I found the immigration windows and I was processed within 5 minutes at no cost. I then went to the customs to have the 50 Dollar TIP that I had bough only 3 hours ago cancelled, but the guy there wanted in addition to my usual documentation, a copy of the CA-4 stamps in my passport.</p>
<p>As I did not have a copy of these, having just received three new ones, I had to go and get a copy. This is when I was pestered by another Honduran &ldquo;helper&rdquo; I tried to get rid of him as I knew what I was doing and I didn&rsquo;t need his help but like a wasp around a jam jar, he constantly buzzed around me, tying to take the documents out of my hand and rabbiting on in Spanish at 100 miles an hour.</p>
<p>Eventually I gave in, gave him my documents, he got me the photocopy that I needed, took all the documents to the customs guy and I got my TIP cancelled in 5 minutes. I gave him 200 Honduran Lempira, about 8 US Dollars, he didn&rsquo;t seem happy but that&rsquo;s all I had.</p>
<p>Then I got on the bike and rode 100 yards to the Nicaraguan border crossing buildings. This was the same procedure as my last entry except that I didn&rsquo;t get charged the 13 US Dollar entry fee. I paid the 3 US Dollar tourist tax and the 4 US Dollar bike poison spraying fee. Then the customs did my bag search, then I had to find the police had to stamp my customs declaration form, then I got the TIP. The TIP only took 10 minutes and didn&rsquo;t cost me anything but the whole process took over an hour.</p>
<p>I was so distracted by my Honduran &ldquo;helper&rdquo; that I forgot to photograph my bike outside the relevant buildings at this border crossing. However, I did photograph the &ldquo;Welcome to Nicaragua&rdquo; sign as left the border area</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/posts/129-130/05-129.jpg"/> 
</figure>

<p>and where I stopped a few hundred yards from this sign to sort out my bags, and I saw a couple of horses parked at the side of the road.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/posts/129-130/06-129.jpg"/> 
</figure>

<p>I had booked a rural Finca as my accommodation for the night so I rode from El Espino to the town of Esteli and then I took the road to my accommodation which was allegedly 20 miles away. Google maps did it&rsquo;s usual and after two hours of scrambling up and down what can only be described as rocky goat tracks, I got to the location and there was nothing there. So I scrambled up and down some more until I got to a paved road and headed for the nearest town, San Sebastian De Yali where I found a very basic hotel which cost me 300 Cordobas for the night, about 8 US Dollars.</p>
<p>By the time that I got in to the hotel I was knackered so I got a couple of coffees at a nearby bar and got some well needed sleep.</p>
<h1 id="day-130">Day 130<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#day-130"></a></h1><p>I got up and as I was putting my bags on to the bike in order to leave my cheap hotel I noticed that the front tyre looked soft, I checked the tyre pressure and it was only 10 PSI, I blew it up to 28 PSI with my air compressor and finished packing the bike. I checked the tyre pressure just before I set off and it was down to 25. This was about 8 o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p>
<p>I realised that I had a slow puncture so I set off to find a tyre repair place and I found one a short distance from the hotel. I took the front wheel off but I had to wait a while as the tyre guy was repairing a tyre from a large truck.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/posts/129-130/07-129.jpg"/> 
</figure>


<figure>
    <img src="/posts/129-130/08-129.jpg"/> 
</figure>

<p>Once the guy could look at my tyre he took the inner tube out of the wheel and, Yes I did have a puncture! The tube was patched in no time and the guy then examined the tyre for the source of the puncture, he quickly found and removed a large thorn that I had obviously run over whilst scrambling up and down the rocky trails the day before.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/posts/129-130/09-129.jpg"/> 
</figure>

<p>Once the front wheel was back on the bike it was now just after 9 o&rsquo;clock in the morning and I set off back to the town of Esteli and then headed South on Highway 1 in the direction of the city of Granada that sits on the Western shore of lake Xolotian. I stopped on the road from Esteli and took a photo of the great view of the mountains in the distance that I got in this part of Nicaragua.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/posts/129-130/10-129.jpg"/> 
</figure>

<p>I stopped about an hour further down the road to have a look at a river and as I did so I saw a guy on a bike with a huge parcel of stuff on the back. This is typical of how the people in Central America use their small bikes for, on one occasion whilst I was in Honduras I passed a guy who was carrying a 10 foot ladder over his shoulder whilst riding. All very surreal.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/posts/129-130/11-129.jpg"/> 
</figure>

<p>I got to the city of Granada at about 2 o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon and once in my hotel which I paid 780 Cordobas (21 US Dollars) I wandered around the place for a while.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/posts/129-130/12-129.jpg"/> 
</figure>


<figure>
    <img src="/posts/129-130/13-129.jpg"/> 
</figure>

    <img src="/posts/129-130/14-129.jpg"/>

</figure>


<figure>
    <img src="/posts/129-130/16-129.jpg"/> 
</figure>

<p>I found the place to be very clean and it had a very relaxing atmosphere to it. This place is a smaller, nicer, less touristy version of Antigua Guatemala and it is a place that I would recommend to anyone visiting Nicaragua.</p>
<p>I returned to my hotel and attended to the usual stuff and sort out my documents as I panned to cross the border from Nicaragua in to Costa Rica the following morning.</p>
