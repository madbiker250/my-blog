My name is Tom Mackay and I am The MadBiker and before I shall write anything else I shall answer the obvious question, why did I choose that name to call my online self? 

When I informed those that knew me that I was giving up a well paid job, selling or giving away all of my worldly possessions, and leaving behind a comfortable lifestyle to travel the word on a bike, a lot of people told me that I was Mad!

I am from the city of Glasgow in Scotland and I have been been riding bikes continuously since the age of seventeen.

This blog is an attempt to document my Round The World trip that I embarked on in 2017 and it is primarily intended for those who personally know me and for those who do not but who are interested in reading what I have written, and what I shall write, concerning my travels.

The blog is easily navigated as it is indexed by date, cagegories, and tags allowing a reader to look at only the content that is of interest to them. 

Reviews of any riding gear or accessories that I use during my trip are posted on my main "website" a link to which you can find at the top of each page.

Any opinions and views expressed by me in this blog have been formed through personal experience and are expressed with the sole intention of providing accurate information about my travells in the places that I have ridden in during my trip or to provide an alternative perspective on biking in a crazy world. 

I do not wish to offend anyone, intentionally or otherwise, however I am aware that some people may be more easily offended than others, therefore If any of the content of this website or the views expressed within are not to your liking, then please exercise your freedom of choice to go to another blog or website that better suits your particular tastes.

I hope that you will find this blog entertaining and if you have any suggestions as to what content could be added to improve it then please use the email button at the bottom of this page to contact me.
