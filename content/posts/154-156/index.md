# Day 154

I set off early and I climbed back out of Iqieque and back on to Route 5 South where I refuelled shorty after re-joining it. I was in for yet another 150 mile stretch of empty road before I would get to the next petrol station. It was cold but at least it was sunny and there were no head winds. I had done about 80 miles when I encountered another customs checkpoint in the middle of nowhere. There was a large bus stopped in it and all of the passengers had to disembark and have their bags and documents checked. 

I thought that it was only for freight and buses so I went to the exit barrier but I was told to turn around and present my TIP to the customs guy in the office which I then did. He looked at it stamped it on the back with two different stamps and then signed it before giving it back to me. That was it, nothing else, bureaucracy at its finest. I took a photo of the place and of the two large dogs that kept chasing me about trying to bite my front tyre as I rode about the place.

Then I rode to the barrier and showed the guy my stamped TIP, he then opened the barrier and I was on my way again. After just under three hours of riding I reached a major crossroads junction where the on-line maps indicated that there was a petrol station close by. I rode for about 10 miles to the West before I found the turn off to take me to the small village of Maria Elena in the middle of nowhere that had a petrol station. Eventually I found it and I refuelled.

Now this is where I need to have a rant.

The crossroads junction that I previously mentioned is probably the most important junction in the North of Chile but there is absolutely nothing there, no petrol station, no toilets, and nowhere to eat or drink. Now the closest places to do any of these things are Iquique (100 miles North) Calama close to Bolivia (50 miles East) and Tocopilla on the Pacific coast (50 miles West) yet they have a tiny petrol station tucked away in a village 10 miles from the main road.

Now I know that one of the problems with placing services in remote areas is how to get the staff there but for goodness sake the people who work in the Maria Elena petrol station probably live in the village as there is nothing else around for miles so why not situate the petrol station at the crossroads? Is it just me or am I missing something here? Anyway rant over.

I re-joined the main road and steeled myself for another 100 mile ride through nothing until the next petrol station. As It was by now approaching two o'clock in the afternoon the sun was shining strongly and the air started to heat up. This then brought the head winds and the flurries of sand across the road again. 

As I reached the end of yet another 100 miles of sheer emptiness I saw a toll both and just behind it the petrol station. This toll both charged me 1,300 pesos whilst the 2 previous ones had only charged me 650 Pesos on each occasion. Once refuelled I took a break at the petrol station which had some toilets but nothing else.

I drank  one of the two bottles of water that I carry with me and then I saw that I was only about 30 miles or so from the city of Antofagasta so I looked on-line and found a cheapish hostel with a single room and parking for 20,000 Pesos (20 USD) for the night.

Once there I had to go out and find an electrical adapter as the previous evening I had discovered that Chile does not use the same type of electrical sockets that are used in most of the Americas, they use the 2 round pin type like they use in Europe. I bought one at a mobile phone kiosk in a local supermarket but I got stung for 10 USD to buy it.

Then I flagged down a taxi and asked him to take me to the city centre, it was only about a 3 mile journey that took about 5 minutes but it cost me 5 USD. Then I walked about and had a look at the centre of the city but I didn't like what I saw.

A lot of the shops looked empty and lots of them were available to rent. The place also looked quite grubby and and it had a very down at heel feel to it. I walked back to my accommodation and this just re-enforced my view that the place was a complete dump.

Since I entered Peru and Chile I have to admit to not liking these countries very much. The main problem that I have with them both is the complete and utter boredom of riding through the long stretches of empty desert where there is literally nowhere to stop for a break and I mean absolutely nowhere unless you count a lay by at the side of the road. If find riding like this very tiring and I do not enjoy it but at the moment all I can do is what I have been doing and that is to get my head down and ride through the large stretches of empty dessert and keep hoping that it will soon come to an end.

# Day 155

So I set off at around nine o'clock in the morning and once I re-joined Rote 5 I rode for about 30 miles to the last petrol station for 120 miles. Another two hours of sheer boredom passed and as I got near to the petrol station the head winds started again. I refuelled and set off again but after about only 2 miles the biked dropped out of gear and would not engage any gear. I rolled to a stop but there was nothing that I could do, the bike wasn't going anywhere.

Fortunately the bike decided to break down beside a water pumping station that had people working in it so I rolled the bike down on to the access road to the pumping station as far as it would go and then I went in to the place and spoke to the men inside.

The men working there were good enough to call a tow truck from the town of Taltal which was about 40 miles away to the South. 
I waited for a couple of hours and then the bike was put on to the back of the tow truck and we all set off for Taltal.

We arrived in Taltal at around 4 o'clock in the afternoon and the bike was deposited at the workshop where the tow truck was based out of. The 40 odd mile trip cost me 150,000 Pesos (150 USD) This works out at about just over 3 USD per mile whilst flying my bike from Panama to Colombia worked out at 2 USD per mile! 

As there were no bike shops or bike mechanics in Taltal I was going to have to deal with the problem myself but it would have to wait till the next day.
