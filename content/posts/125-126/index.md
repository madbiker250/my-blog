# Day 125

When I took a few days off in Antigua Guatemala right across the road from my hotel was a bike shop so I took the opportunity to have the guys who ran the shop try to straighten out my rear wheel ABS rotor. As the bike had just turned 5000 miles on the clock I asked them to change the engine oil while they were at it. They straightened the rotor for me but the malfunction on the rear ABS is still there, I will need to buy a new ABS rotor on my return to Panama city.

I had planned a short riding day, my destination for the day was Port San Jose on the Pacific coast some 50 miles or so away. I left Antigua Guatemala about 10 o'clock in the moring and to be honest ride there was pretty uninspiring because the heat haze was very thick and I could not see very much. I arrived at my destination at about 1 0'clock in the afternoon and eventually found my hotel no thanks to Google maps that had me going in circles for about an hour. Once unpacked I got changed and headed out in a 3 wheeled taxi to have a look at the beach.

The sand was a chocolate brown colour due to the volcanic nature of this part of the country, I went for a paddle in the Pacific Ocean and the water was warm. The sand was absolutely scorching and I nearly burned the soles of my feet only walking on it for 20 yards or so before I hit the wet, and cooler sand.

The beach is very wide and there were lots of locals scooting up and down it on 4 wheeled buggies. I walked along the beach for a while and I came across and old pier that had disintegrated.

A small seawater canal separated the beach from the town, unfortunately it was full of rubbish and it was bordered on one side by some shanty town dwellings. As I was taking the photograph and inhabitant of one of the shacks threw some rubbish in to the water.

I then walked back in to the town but there was not much to see other than the usual road chaos with lots of bikes with multiple persons onboard, even small children sitting on the petrol tank in front of their parent.

I had debated staying in this place for a few days if it was nice but it was not so I returned to my hotel and planned my route for the following day. At least the hotel was nice enough at 175 Quetzals (22 US Dollars) and it had secure overnight parking for the bike.

# Day 126

The previous night I had decided that I had had enough of Guatemala and I decided to cross the border in to El Salvador. I awoke early and I was out of the hotel and on the road for just before 7 o'clock in the morning. I headed North on road number CA-9 and then turned East on to road number CA-2 that would take me to the border. 

In the distance to the South I saw a giant plume of smoke that was obviously coming from a volcano but I was too far away to see the actual volcano. The road started to rise as I neared the border and first I stopped to photo a large lake that sat at the side of the road

and then to take a photo of some wetlands that also sat near to the road.

On looking at this photograph one would think that Guatemala is a beautiful place to travel in but as I have already mentioned even this view was spoiled for me by the large amount of litter dumped in the layby that I stopped in to take the photograph. See for yourself what I mean.

I reached the Guatemalan side of the border shortly before 9 o'clock in the morning where I was directed to park my bike in the middle of the road outside the immigration and customs building

I then went to immigration where I got cleared for exit to El Salvador in about 10 minutes at no cost. I then went to the Guatemalan customs to have the TIP for my bike cancelled and this was another dose of the border crossing pantomime. I needed to give them my passport and original bike documents plus copies of each, which I had. No problem. I had also to give them my driving licence, the Guatemalan TIP that I wanted cancelled, plus copies of each.

They also wanted a copy of the page of my passport which had all my previous C4-A stamps in it. (Nicaragua, Honduras, and Guatemala) Since I did not have these copies I had to trot off to a small building that had the copy sign outside it. When I got there it was basically someone's house with a scanner and a photocopier in the kitchen.

I gave what I needed to be copied to the old woman who obviously owned the house and operated the photocopying racket, sorry I meant business. I got a total of 15 sheets of A4 paper of the copies that I needed and it cost me 50 Quetzals, just over 6 US Dollars thank you very much!

I then trotted back to the Guatemalan customs with all of the relevant documents and copies, they guy came out and checked the frame number on my bike and then he cancelled my TIP, stamped one part of it that he gave me to show to the customs guys at the actual border, again this was all done at no cost. I got on the bike and headed over the bridge, showed my cancelled TIP to the Guatemalan customs guys who signed it and then I entered El Salvador.

I parked up at the El Salvadorian immigration and customs offices.

The time was now 10 o'clock. I went to immigration, the guy stamped my passport, wrote in the number of days that I had left in the C4-A area, and welcomed me to El Salvador. All done if under 5 minute. The i went to the customs for my TIP. They needed my passport, original bike documents, plus one copy of each and my cancelled Guatemalan TIP. I was given a from to fill out with the usual details, you know the stuff that was already in my documents. I filled it out signed it and my bike was once again examined for the frame number. after that I was issued with my TIP and that was it, all done in 30 minutes.

I stopped just after the El Salvadorian border for the usual photo and again a short distance down the road for the main sign to indicate that I was now in El Slavador.

I continued to ride South on road number CA-2 and after a while I turned North on to road number CA-12 in the direction of the capital San Salvador and then at the town of Sonsonate I peeled off in the direction of Santa Ana that would be my destination for the evening.

The road started climbing and as it rose up in to the mountains I saw that the tops were covered in cloud, surprisingly though when I entered the cloud it was not cold, that's a definite firsts for me on a bike. Once above the clouds I was again in sunshine and shortly after I began descending in to Santa Ana.

I tried to find my accommodation for the night, a hostel near the centre of the city, but again I had a tussle with Google maps. As I had forgotten to buy a SIM card at the border I had offline maps but no internet. Eventually with the help of a guy in a shop where the Google maps directed me to I found the place and he telephoned the owner, who arrived within a few minutes. 

The owner and his wife, Manuel and Marisha, were most welcoming and did everything they could to make me feel welcome.

I then ventured out and bought a SIM card for 1 Us Dollar and 4 US Dollars for a top up, they use US Dollars as the currency here in El Salvador, but for some reason it was not working properly and that I would probably have to buy another one so I realised that that was my fist job for the next day.

In the courtyard of the hostel building there was a tree with some odd looking fruit like things growing on it.

I asked Manuel about this and in Spanish they are called Morra, apparently they take the seed out, dry them, grind them up in to a powder, and make a drink from the powder.
