# Costa Rica

It is a very expensive country when compared to all of the other countries that I have visited in Central America. I had mixed feelings about my time in the country, the Caribbean side is a complete dump but still as expensive as the rest of the country which in parts was also a dump. The Capital city San Jose for example, was also a dump whereas the coffee growing area of San Marcos that I stayed in was very nice but also very expensive. 

The people that I met and interacted with were on the most part friendly but I experienced a kind of general attitude from others that was along the lines of "here's another rich tourist, let's fleece him" which I did not like. Now this may be down to the fact that Costa Rica is a very popular destination for American tourists but I can not say for sure, however this feeling that I got tended to help me form the opinion that I didn't like the place very much. 

Another thing that I did not like, nor expect, was the amount of litter that was along the side of every road that rode on, the Capital city, San Jose although very bad for litter, decaying buildings, and decaying infrastructure was not the worst place that i visited in Costa Rica, that honour goes to the Caribbean town of Limon, what a shit hole!

# Nicaragua

I liked Nicaragua a lot, the people that I met and interacted with were all very friendly, the roads were generally very good and although here and there there was some litter decorating the roads, by and large it was the cleanest country of those that I visited. The only exception to this was on the outskirts of the Caribbean town of Puerto Cabeza where there were a couple of huge piles of empty plastic bottles that had been dumped by the roadside and now being scattered around by the wind. 

I was also very cheap in comparison to Costa Rica and there was a nice laid back feel to the place. Outside of Managua the majority of the people all seemed to live in wooden shacks along the side of the roads, whether they had running water and or electricity is debatable, but even when I stopped in one of these small towns for a coffee I did not get the feeling that I was being fleeced. 

For example the average price that I paid for a cup of coffee in Costa Rica was about 3 to 5 US Dollars, whereas in Nicaragua if was never more than 1 US Dollar and often about half of that. Of course that was except in a very nice restaurant situated on the main road in the centre of Managua where I paid 3 US Dollars.

# Honduras

I had obviously heard stories about how dangerous it was for tourists in Honduras before I got there, however despite this I never saw anything that I would consider dangerous and at no time did I ever feel uncomfortable or that I might be in any possible danger for the 2 days that I spent in the country. 

Having said that, in the two places that I stayed in every bank, supermarket, petrol station, and business that obviously dealt with cash, had armed security guards standing outside them. In the Capital city of Tegucigalpa not far from where I was staying, I even saw an armed security guard standing outside a ladies hairdressers.

Now even although I never saw anything that gave me cause for concern, it is quite obvious to me that these armed security guards are there for a reason, no business would go to the expense of hiring these guys if they were not needed. 

I should also mention here that I never ventured out of my accommodation when it was dark although whilst in Tegucigalpa I had a balcony that overlooked the street outside. As I sat on the balcony I saw at least a couple of police patrols pass by, they were driving pick up trucks and each of them had 4 police officers standing in the rear, with their AK 47 assault rifles at the ready. 

The only place that I saw in Honduras that I liked was the beach at Puerto Cortes but even that is not enough to make me want to ever return to the country.

# Guatemala

Like Honduras I had heard lot of stories about how beautiful Guatemala was and what a nice country it was to visit, however in my experience the country is a complete shit hole! At the side of every road that I rode on both verges were filled with litter, obviously thrown from passing vehicles and this was even on very rural roads where no-one lived. 

In much the same way as Nicaragua, the vast majority of the population outside of the cities and large towns, seem to live in wooden shacks at the side of the roads. The roads except for in the North and the West of the country are very poorly maintained and they are also filled with speed bumps that are unmarked, and sometimes just around a corner where they can not be seen till it's too late to slow down.

In Guatemela I got the same impression from the staff at nearly every place that I stayed in that I did in Costa Rica, a mix of resentment and disinterest, again this may be due to the large number of American tourists that visit the place. 

For example, in my hotel in Flores, the shower in my room did not work, so when I asked the owner about it, he just shrugged his shoulders and told me that if I wanted another room he could give me one, but... as that room had air conditioning, well that was another 10 US Dollars thank you very much.

The place that I stayed at in Coban was ran by a very surly young woman who could barely take here nose out of her mobile phone in order to speak to me and room that I got was just about big enough to swing a cat in. So when all of my luggage was in the room with the single bed the place was full, and I mean full. 

The only place in Guatemala that I stayed at where my accommodation was both nice and value for money was the hotel that I stayed at in Quetzaltenango, here the staff there were all both very nice and very helpful.

Antigua Guatemala was full of young American and European tourists, mostly the hippy or New Age types, filling up the Vegan only restaurants and herbal drink shops, buying all the "Genuine" hand crafted multi coloured woven cloth wrist or ankle bands, bags, rugs, and every other useless item that you could imagine, from the multitude of tourist tat shops that filled the place. 

The shops advertising guided tours to the Inca ruins, Volcanos. etc. were also full of them, all intent on getting their next true "Guatemalan experience" going to these locations in a bus filled with other tourists. How stupid, deluded, and blind must these people be to then write a lot of shit on their Facebook pages telling everyone that they know, about their unique (along with a million others) Guatemalan experiences and about what a wonderful country Guatemala is. 

Maybe it's just me but as I mentioned at the start of this section, Guatemala is a very beautiful country that is awash with litter and decay and I can not understand how others that have been here can not see it. 

In my previous bog posts about my time riding through the country I wrote about an incident that I witnessed where a woman passenger on a bike dropped litter on to the road as the bike was travelling along it. In a similar vein,

I am sick and tired of hearing stuff about how these countries are in a mess because of corruption, and because of exploitation by the so-called first world nations, and whilst that might be true from an economic standpoint, to me the only thing that explains why most of these countries are giant rubbish dumps is primarily because of the behaviour of the people who live in them.

It is no wonder that Guatemala is a shit hole and it has the honour of being another country that I will not be going back to except to pass through as quickly as I can.
