It has now been 4 years since I left the UK on my adventures, however, as I mentioned in my previous post because of all of the madness engendered in politicians in respect of restrictions on individual movement I am unable to travel much and I am presently marking time in Krakow in Poland. 

I just thought that I would post this update on my stalled RTW trip and to share a few photographs of my jaunts around Southern Poland in to the Tatra Mountains and Krakow during the last few months of captivity.
