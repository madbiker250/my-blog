# Six Years Down

As I sit here in the city of Reus in Spain contemplating the choice of destination for continuing my RTW trip on my bike, I sometimes reflect on the six years that have passed since I permanently left the UK. When I think about my travels on my bike throughout Europe in those six years it seems only months ago that I started my journey, however, when I think about the madness that the world has descended in to since 2020 it seems like an eterniy has passed and that nightmare will never end.

I am thoroughly disgusted with those who have the power to make the lives of ordinary people better but for some reason known only to themselves, they choose not to. I can only hope that later this year when I do continue my journey somewhere other than Europe, that part of the world will provide me from some respite from what I have exerienced in Europe since 2020.

Without exception every person that I have met and interacted with on my travels in Europe was a friendly decent human being which is more than can be said for those who are "elected" to supposedly represent our interests.
