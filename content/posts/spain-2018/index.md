So........ the story so far.

I left Reus in Catalunya in December 2018 for the home of my good friend Graham, in Galicia, with only a vague idea about what I wanted to do next. En route I decided to visit the city of Leon, one that I had always wanted to see but had never actually gotten around to visiting. Leon lived up to my expectations.

I spent a night in a hotel that was not only a hotel but also a museum and one of the oldest buildings in that part of Spain.

On my arrival in Glaicia I took the opportunity afforded to me by my friend to spend from December 2018 till April 2019 at his beautiful and tranquil home thinking about my lack of travel on my bike over the past year or so and what direction I wanted this blog to go in.

My decision to remain in Spain to learn the language was correct as I am now very passable in Spanish, however, I spent too much of my time in having a normal life instead of using my time there to do more riding and in hindsight this was a mistake, as the reason I stepped off the "Hamster Wheel" in the first place was so that I would no longer have a normal life.

Galicia in winter is much like Scotland in the Spring, sometimes cold and wet, however on sunny cloudless days it is very much warmer than Scotland and I took full advantage of this to ride my bike in some spectacular scenery.

My friend and I also took the opportunity to explore some of the smaller towns and villages near to where he stays and to give his dog an occasional wash.

After I had taken enough time to get things straight in my mind about my true direction, I needed to move on.

Travelling on the bike was always intended to be my first priority but somewhere along the way I lost perspective on that and I allowed other things to get in the way of what I really wanted to do, ride my bike around the world.

I suppose that what happened to me over the last two years was good for me as it has provided me with clarity on my intended purpose. 

My life over the past two years has also, on occasions, reminded me of why I stepped of the "Hamster Wheel" in the first place and of why I never want to go back on to it again.

And so the journey continues !
