# Day 138

I was glad that it was time to leave Cartagena and although it was Saurday morning I headed out early in order to avoid any traffic only to find that there was some sort of cycle race taking place and the road out was full of cyclists. Once I had negoitated my way out of the city without mowing down any of the cyclists that were wandering about on the road I headed for the city of Baranquilla which was about fifty miles further up the coast. The road was not particularly interesting apart from having to go over a large but newish suspension bridge that spanned a wide river as I left Cartagena.

An hour or so later I rode through the city of Baranquilla and to be honest although it was a bit cleaner than Cartagena there did not appear to be much that I saw which I liked. When I encountered the main market area it was just the same traffic and pedestrian chaos as in Cartagena. As I left the city in the direction of Santa Marta the roads got much quieter and at one point the road again ran along the coast for a bit where I saw lots of guys fishing and some of them were standing at the side of the road holding massive fish which they were trying to entice passing motorist to stop and buy from them. I stopped for a photo or two.

One of the fishermen came up to me and asked if I wanted to buy a fish from him but obviously I was unable to do so. However I did give him a few thousand Pesos and asked him to take a photo of me standing beside the bike which he did. As can be seen in the photo looking scruffy has its advantages as looking like this prevents the criminal types from thinking that I may have lots of valuables that are worth robbing me of.

Since I started my trip here in Central and South America I have been unable to buy a pair of leather bike trousers here and it is way too hot to wear the waterproof riding suit trousers, so I had to buy a pair of heavy duty cargo pants which do not have any knee protection. In Bogota I was able to buy a pair of strap on knee protectors for about 20 USD. Now I don't know how much good that they will do if I do have a spill but I am sure that wearing them will be better than having nothing.

As short distance from where I had gotten the fisherman to take my photograph I entered the town of Cienaga and the traffic there was insane for a small town. When I eventually got through the huge traffic queue to the outskirts of the town I saw that where the main road splits to go in the direction of either Bogota or Santa Marta the traffic in the direction of Bogota was at a standstill, presumably because of some road accident or some other enforced road closure. Once on the way to Santa Marta the road ran along the coastline with lush mountains high above me to the other side and in parts it was elevated which gave me the occassional good view out over the sea. I then spotted a small roadise restaurant where I stopped for a break.

I got my usual plate of meat, bottle of water and two coffees but it was rather expensive for here at 44,000 Pesos which is about 10 USD. A I reached the town of Santa Marta at around noon and I managed to get down on to the road that runs along the sea front where I stopped to take a few pictures.

I will be returning to Santa Marta when I head back South in a few days time so I didn't spend a lot of time looking around the city. I then headed out in the direction of Riohacha where I had planned to stay for a few nights. As I got closer to Riohacha I noticed that the lush mountains had receeded inland quite a bit and the area was becoming much more arid, this is because the town of Riohacha is at the Southeren end of the La Guajira desert.

Everything was going fine until I reached Riohacha. I stopped at the side of the town to use my mobile phone to locate my hotel and my internet had stopped working. I had downloaded the map of the area so that I could use offline navigation if necessary but I couldn't access my hotel booking online so I had to just guess as t where it was in the town. As I was about so set off I pushed the rear brake peddal as I making a slow turn and nothing happened. A quick look at the bike revealled that the nut that secured the brake pedal on to the frame of the bike had obviously unwound itself and there was my brake pedal unattached to the bike and just balanced on the footrest!

Luckilly I did not loose any of the other rear brake parts so I stuffed it in to my tankbag and rode the short distance to where I thought my hotel was located. I rode around for a bit but it was getting very warm so I pulled in to the side of the street and decided to pause, have a drink of water, and do a bit of thinking. I removed the Colombian SIM card from my phone and then I very carefully scraped the back of it with my knife to create a better contact surface, once it was back in in my phone it started working again and I had internet. It transpired that my hotel was located only a couple of hundered yards away from where I had thought it to be and I was glad to arrive at the hotel unscathed. Ridding in busy traffic without a rear brake is not something that I enjoyed!

My hotel was nice at 60,000 Pesos a night which is about 15 USD and more importantly it was very clean and had a secure parking garage for the bike. Like a lot of places that I have stayed in in Central and South America the hotel did not have any hot water so after a cold shower I headed out to explore the town.

I then headed to the beach and I found that the pavement on the sea front was full of people selling the local tourist tat and the local council workers were busy erecting Christmas decorations.

There was a wooden walkway out to a pier to where a fishing boat was moored against it and the workmen had installed some more Christmas decorations all along the walkway out to the pier.

The sea here close to the shore has a browninsh colour only turning blue much further out. I presumed that the currents here cause a lot of sand to be churrned up causing this discolouration of the water or it could be the result of untreated sewage discharge but either way I decided not to sick my toe in the water.

As I had decided to stay a few night in Riohacha so the following morning my first job was to re-attach my rear brake peddal to my bike. I managed to obtain a new securing nut at a small local bike shop so I set about making the repair.

Once my rear brake was functional again I headed out for a well earned coffee and cigar and whilst I waas sitting in a cafe at the side of the road at the beach I saw another example of how the locals ride about in this part of the world. Four people on one scooter.
