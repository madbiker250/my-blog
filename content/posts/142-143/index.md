# Day 142

The next morning as I prepared to leave my hotel it was overcast and the rain had just stopped. The previous evening I had looked at the map and I had decided to return to route 43 on which I would head South on but for some unknown reason I forgot about that and I headed South out of the city on route 45. It was cool and the further South I went, although I was constantly descending, it got cooler and then it started to rain. 

Once I had stopped to put on my rain gear I realied my mistake of taking the wrong road South and I looked at my options. To get back on to route 43 I needed to either return to Neiva some 70 miles back to the North or continue riding South and then head West either on route 20 to Popayan or to ride even further South before heading West on route 10 to Pasto. As route 20 was closer and as it was a shorter crossing I decided to take that one. Everything was going well on nice tarmac and concrete roads until about 27 miles in to the 80 mile cross country jaunt when the tarmac disappeared.

Then it was another long hard ride on 40 miles of pothole filled and rock strewen dirt track and to top it all off it started to rain heavilly. As the road climbed higher and higher it got colder and colder and at one point near the summit the temperature had fallen to 14 degrees celcius, something that I had not expected this close to the equator.

I then spent the next two hours overtaking and dodging oncoming bikes, cars, buses, and articulated lorries that were also on this road. What such large vehicles were doing on this road I do not know but if this is the normal traffic for this road I can see why it is in such a state of disrepair. Again for most of the time I was standing up on the bike footpegs in order to make it eaier to avoid the worst of the potholes and it was yet another unecessary long and difficult off road ride for me caused by my own stupidity.

Once I descended the other side of the mountain the rain stopped and the tarmac reappeared. I reached Popayan as the sun came out but I did not stop until I was well out of the city. Once refuelled and out of my rain gear I rode South on route 43 and my plan was to stop about 50 miles or so from the border between Colombia and Ecuador but by late afternoon I had decided that I was done for the day so I set about looking for somewhere to stay for the night. Now that the low cloud and rain had lifted from the mountains this was the first opportunity that I had to stop and take a photograph and the scenery was spectacular.

In the small town of El Bordo I found a hotel which was a expensive at about 36 USD for the night but as there was not a lot of choice in the town and as I could park the bike beside my room I decided to bite the bullet and pay it.

My numerous recent dirt track excursions have coated the bike with a thick layer of mud and despite the cleansing efforts of the heavy rain the mud appears to have been baked on and the bike now needs a good wash.

# Day 143

The previous night after it had gotten dark the skies had opened and the rain started. On my travels I use a small front disc brake lock which has a small battery powered alarm built in to it. Once locked any vibrations to the bike such as someone trying to move it will set the alarm off however falling rain never does. Well it did that night. As I was sitting outside my room smoking a cigar and as the rain got heavier the alarm started to go off so I put the cover over the bike, getting thouroughly drenched in the process, thinking that that would stop the issue. It did not, the heavy raindrops flattened the cover on to the bike and again the alarm activated but luckily the rain eased and the alarm stopped activatiing.

When I went to bed I had left my stainless steel camping mub and my leather riding gloves on a snall table outside my room. On getting up that moring my gloves had disappeared but thankfully the camping mug was still there. The hotel entrance on the main road some 50 yards away was not secureed during the night and some theiving bastard obviously entered the hotel grounds and swiped my govles. Either that or a stray dog took then to play with.

I had gotten out of bed at seven o'clock in the moring and by half past seven the rain started again. I had my breakfast and waited till the rain eased which was around ten o'clock. I headed South and the road again descened as I rode and as it did it got warmer and the sun would ocassionally break through the clouds to give the air temperature a slight boost. When I stopped to refuell I removed my rain gear and set off for the city of Pasto some 100 miles to the South. It was initially quite pleasant riding along but as the road rose steeply through spectacular scenery it got colder and the odomoter on the bike turned to 9,000 miles.

The road continued to rise and then it descened it to the city of Pasto which sits at an altitude of just over 2,500 meteres above sea level. I negotiated my way through the city and then I started a very steep climb out of the city to the South. The climb was so steep that for long stretches I could not use any gear above third and yet I was still overtaking lots of cars and lorries on the dual carriageway road that wound it's way up the mountainside. At the summit there was a toll booth and as I approached it clounds swept on for the East and enveloped everything. Once through the toll both and on the other side of the mountain, no clouds, it a really weird experience. 

Once over the summit it was a long but rapid descent down and in to a valley where I stopped to put my rain gear on as showers were now appearing. I also took the opportunity to take a couple of photographs of where I had just come from and the climb I had yet to make.

I had decided to stay for a few nights in a small hotel in a small village called San Juan which, when I toook the above photographs, was only about 15 miles away and situated just off of the main maion road. The reason that I was heading to this particular hotel was because I had found it on the IOverlander site and the previous occupants had reported that the hotel had hot showers in the rooms, something I have not enjoyed since leaving Bogota some six weeks ago.

Anyway it was another third gear long climb up the mountainside and then a rapid descent in a freezing cold rainstorm until I reached the pint where I needed to leave the main road and enter the village. When I reahced the hotel at around three o'clock in the afternoon the first thing that I did was have a long hot shower. It was so good to shower in hot water again.
