# Impressions of Santa Marta

I stayed in Santa Marta for about XXX weeks and I liked the city a lot.

The city has a very laid back and relaxed atmosphere which I enjoyed. The main tourist area is situated just a few streets back from the main road that runs along the sea front. During the day it is very relaxed and it has a main small tree filled square that is full of restaurants that have outdoor seating. This was my favourite place to sit and drink coffee whilst smoking my cigars and watching the world go by.

The trees here are also inhabited by red squirrels with huge tails, much like the ones that I have seen in my home country of Scotland but somehow, maybe because of the strong sunlight here, they appear to have a brighter reddish colour to their fur than those back home. They were very entertaining to watch as they scurried about looking for food.

Some of the surrounding streets are also tree lined giving people some welcome shade frrom the sun which in my estimation is very much stronger here than in Panama, probably because Colombia is nearer to the Equator.

The sea front has a nice but relavively short walkway with the usual tourist traps placed strategically along it and at the Southeren end of this there is a small beach.

A statue of someone had also been placed on the walkway but there was nothing written on it anywhere to suggest who it is of. However I did a bit of online research and I found out that it a statue of Rodrigo de Bastidas, a Spanish conquistador who founded the city in 1524.

At night time the main tourist are comes alive with lots of bars and restaurants pumping out very loud music. There was a strange mix of locals and tourists in the area but unfortunatley when I was there at night time I was constanlty pestered by people begging for money, something that still happened to me during the day but it hapened much less during the day than it did at night time.
