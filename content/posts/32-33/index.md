# Day 32

As I departed from the Gasthof the weather was not great and it started to rain a little. Once again, I stayed off the motorways as much as possible but progress was slow and occasionally to make up some time I was forced to use the Autobahn. As a result these was little to see and even less reason to stop and photograph anything.

I crossed the border in to the Czech Republic in the rain and rode across to the other side of the county but all the while it continued to rain intermittently. I only stopped for petrol and then moved on trying to get to my destination for that day, the city of Brno as quickly as I could. As I arrived in Brno I got caught in a huge thunderstorm and I got thoroughly soaked before reaching my accommodation for the night. Once sorted out, as the rain had passed I walked in to Brno old town and I found it to be quite pleasant, however, the walk in was not quite as nice. There were lots of people hanging around street corners in large groups, mostly men in the twenties and although they never hassled me, I felt a certain tension in the air. In addition, the streets where these groups were congregating were full of litter and graffiti covered almost every wall.

I had to do a favour for someone the next day so I did not ride that day but once the favour had been attended to I spent another evening in Brno old town but to be honest I was glad that I was leaving the following morning as Brno city centre is very touristy but just outside the city centre it is a shit hole and not a place on my “I need to revisit this place” list.

# Day 32

I left Brno the following morning heading for the city of Olomuc, it was overcast and en route I passed through a small village that had a tank parked on a small piece of grass at the side of the road.

Shortly thereafter the rain started but I continued on in the rain and reached Olomuc where I stopped to get coffee and to dry out a little. The rain eased whilst I sat and once I had finished I was able to walk around the town centre which was surprisingly large with many old and ornate buildings including a very ornate fountain.

I then set off for the city of Ostrava and the rain came again. It was raining so hard in Ostrava that I decided not to stop but to push on to get out of the bad weather and a short time later I entered Poland.

My destination was Gliwice where I had agreed to help coach a team for a few weeks and by the time I arrived the sun had thankfully appeared.

# POSTSCRIPT

Although I was staying in Gliwice for a few weeks,whilst I was there I managed to do some away days to Opole, Wroclaw, and Chestohowa and I took some photographs of these Polish cites.
