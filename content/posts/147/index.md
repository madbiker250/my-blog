# Day 147

I took the road back out of Huaquillas and headed for the border. I stopped at the Ecuadorian side to find out that only the Customs were located there so I only had to to cancel my TIP. The process took all of ten minutes and then I rode for about 3 miles until I crossed the actual border and arrived at the Peruvian side.

Both of the Ecuadorian and Peruvian immigration offices are located in the same office so after getting stamped out of Ecuador I just moved to the next window and got stamped in to Peru. The whole process took about twenty minutes as there was a small queue. Then I went to the Peruvian customs to get my TIP. They only needed to see my original bike registration, my passport, my driving licence, and that was all. No copies of anything, such a refreshing change from Central America.

About twenty minutes later I was given a paper copy of my TIP and then I rode to the customs checkpoint where I had to the produce the TIP. Once the TIP was examined I was free to enter Peru and the whole border crossing had only taken about one hour. So I then rode South along the coast on route 1 N and after about 20 miles or so I spotted a beach close to the road so I then rode along a small dirt track from the main road for about 500 yards and I arrived at one of the most pristine beaches that I have ever seen.

As I was returning to the main road I saw a large Iguana lizard run across the dirt track and dive in to a small water filled ditch.

Just after I took the photograph it ran over the water without sinking and disappeared in to the reeds at the other side. I then continued riding South but I soon became disappointed to see that Peru suffered from the same litter problems that plagues Central America.

The Road then turned in from the coast and the scenery changed to arid mountains with deep ravines.

I joined the main road South, which was also called the route 1 N, from Ecuador at the town of Sullana where I refuelled. This road was essentially just a long straight road through what I can only describe as an uninhabited desert. There was also a very strong gusting wind coming off of the sea which was blowing me about which made the ride not only tiring but the wind was also blowing lots of sand over the road and in places it was like a mini sandstorm.

However little did I know that as I passed the town of Piura, which was only about 20 miles further South than Sullana, the next petrol station was 150 miles away in the town of Lambayeque. About 40 miles from Lambayeque the bike went on to its reserve and as I had never ridden further than about 20 miles on reserve I did not know if I would make it to the nearest petrol station or not. About 5 miles later I saw a sign for petrol at the side of the road so I pulled off of the road and rode to the shack to enquire about getting some petrol from the occupants.

A woman then brought a large plastic water bottle full of petrol out of the shack and poured in in to the tank. I do not know how much was in the bottle but I presumed that it was a US Gallon (about 4 litres ) and it cost me 25 Peruvian Sols which was about 6.50 USD. It was almost double the price of a petrol station but I didn't care.

I rode on and filled up at the next petrol station and then I went online to find somewhere to stay for the night as it was about four o'clock in the afternoon. I found a small hotel in the city of Chiclayo a short distance away for about 12 USD and it had secure parking. I rode in to the city but the roads leading to the hotel were some of the worst that I have so far ridden on. They were full of huge potholes and the occasional missing manhole cover plus they were choked with hundreds of three wheeled mototaxis that were doing their best to imitate the Dodgems. It was horrific to ride in.

I eventually reached the hotel but the streets outside the hotel were being dug up and they were flooded in parts. The woman in the hotel told me that they had been working on the street for over a year and had still not sorted the mess out.

I was able to park the bike in a secure garage a short walk from the hotel so I was able to leave most of my bags on the bike overnight which saved me from lugging them up to my room which was a huge bonus for me. Once showered in hot water I took a three wheeled mototaxi to a restaurant which the woman in the hotel had recommended as there was not much nearby.

That ride was insane as the young rider cut everyone up, pulled out in front of oncoming traffic, and rode like a maniac all without having an accident. After about ten minutes of this I reached the restaurant and I was glad to escape the mototaxi uninjured. I then had a nice steak for about 12 USD and I tried a local beer with it.

I walked back in to the city centre which was surprisingly modern but quite clean and I took the usual photographs before heading back to my hotel to get my head down for the night.
