# Day 148

I set of from Chiclayo at about seven o'clock in the morning and I headed South on the main road out of the city. After a couple of hours on the road I stopped in the city of Trujillo to have some breakfast and to put on an extra layer as once again there was a strong cool wind. This time it was blowing some mist in from the sea. On my way out of the city after breakfast I stopped to photograph another example of the appalling litter problem. It was so bad that even as I was riding I could smell the stench of decaying something or other every time I passed something like this.

The very arid deset like terrain continued and once the sun burned through the mist coming off of the sea I was able to stop and photograph the stunning but very barren landscapes.

I reached the city of Chimbote at around lunchtime. This city sits on the coast so I again stopped for a break and although the city itself was pretty unremarkable I nevertheless took a couple of photographs of the seafront.

I set off again and rode South on the main road for another three hours through more spectacular desert type landscapes where the road rose and fell through the mountainous terrain. On occasions from the higher parts of the road the sea could be seen so once again I felt the need to stop and photograph what I thought were the best views that I saw.

As I passed the town of Huarmey and I entered the small hamlet of 9 de Octubre I spotted a hotel at the side of the road next to a restaurant so I pulled in and enquired about getting a room for the night. I was able to bet booked in for the sum of 50 Sols for one night which is about just over 13 USD. The hotel was fantastic as can be seen in the following pictures.
