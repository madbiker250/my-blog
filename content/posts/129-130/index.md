# Day 129

I left San Miguel at about 6 'o'clock in the morning as I knew that I had 2 borders to cross and I wanted to leave sufficient time to do this and get to a place to stay in Nicaragua before it got dark. It took me just about an hour to get to the El Salvadorian Honduran border.

The El Salvadorian side was quick, I had to go to the customs first to get my TIP cancelled. That took all of 5 minutes at no cost. Then I rode about half a mile to the actual border and after my passport was checked I went to immigration. That took 10 minutes to get processed for leaving El Salvador and again at no cost.

Then I rode over a bridge

and I parked up outside the main building on the Honduras side of the bridge.

I went to immigration. That only took 10 minutes and I got processed for entering Honduras at no cost. Then I headed over to the customs to get my TIP and again I was fleeced by a "helper" for 50 US Dollars for my TIP but as it took a total of 30 minutes I thought that it was an acceptable cost for the time saved, and by just before 8 o'clock I was in Honduras and on my way to the Nicaraguan border about 100 miles away.

I rode from the border crossing at El Amatillo towards Choluteca, it was very overcast but as I reached Choluteca I got caught in some very light rain for about 20 miles or so. By the time I had cleared Choluteca and was on the way to the Honduran Nicaraguan border crossing at El Espino the rain had thankfully stopped.

The road climbed and climbed, up in to the warm clouds, and once over the mountains, as I was dropping down the other side, the sun started to appear. Eventually the extremely long line of parked articulated lorries told me that I was approaching the border crossing. 

I got to the Honduran border crossing building at about 10 o'clock in the morning and I parked the bike directly outside. I found the immigration windows and I was processed within 5 minutes at no cost. I then went to the customs to have the 50 Dollar TIP that I had bough only 3 hours ago cancelled, but the guy there wanted in addition to my usual documentation, a copy of the CA-4 stamps in my passport. 

As I did not have a copy of these, having just received three new ones, I had to go and get a copy. This is when I was pestered by another Honduran "helper" I tried to get rid of him as I knew what I was doing and I didn't need his help but like a wasp around a jam jar, he constantly buzzed around me, tying to take the documents out of my hand and rabbiting on in Spanish at 100 miles an hour. 

Eventually I gave in, gave him my documents, he got me the photocopy that I needed, took all the documents to the customs guy and I got my TIP cancelled in 5 minutes. I gave him 200 Honduran Lempira, about 8 US Dollars, he didn't seem happy but that's all I had. 

Then I got on the bike and rode 100 yards to the Nicaraguan border crossing buildings. This was the same procedure as my last entry except that I didn't get charged the 13 US Dollar entry fee. I paid the 3 US Dollar tourist tax and the 4 US Dollar bike poison spraying fee. Then the customs did my bag search, then I had to find the police had to stamp my customs declaration form, then I got the TIP. The TIP only took 10 minutes and didn't cost me anything but the whole process took over an hour.

I was so distracted by my Honduran "helper" that I forgot to photograph my bike outside the relevant buildings at this border crossing. However, I did photograph the "Welcome to Nicaragua" sign as left the border area

and where I stopped a few hundred yards from this sign to sort out my bags, and I saw a couple of horses parked at the side of the road.

I had booked a rural Finca as my accommodation for the night so I rode from El Espino to the town of Esteli and then I took the road to my accommodation which was allegedly 20 miles away. Google maps did it's usual and after two hours of scrambling up and down what can only be described as rocky goat tracks, I got to the location and there was nothing there. So I scrambled up and down some more until I got to a paved road and headed for the nearest town, San Sebastian De Yali where I found a very basic hotel which cost me 300 Cordobas for the night, about 8 US Dollars.

By the time that I got in to the hotel I was knackered so I got a couple of coffees at a nearby bar and got some well needed sleep.


# Day 130

I got up and as I was putting my bags on to the bike in order to leave my cheap hotel I noticed that the front tyre looked soft, I checked the tyre pressure and it was only 10 PSI, I blew it up to 28 PSI with my air compressor and finished packing the bike. I checked the tyre pressure just before I set off and it was down to 25. This was about 8 o'clock in the morning. 

I realised that I had a slow puncture so I set off to find a tyre repair place and I found one a short distance from the hotel. I took the front wheel off but I had to wait a while as the tyre guy was repairing a tyre from a large truck.

Once the guy could look at my tyre he took the inner tube out of the wheel and, Yes I did have a puncture! The tube was patched in no time and the guy then examined the tyre for the source of the puncture, he quickly found and removed a large thorn that I had obviously run over whilst scrambling up and down the rocky trails the day before.

Once the front wheel was back on the bike it was now just after 9 o'clock in the morning and I set off back to the town of Esteli and then headed South on Highway 1 in the direction of the city of Granada that sits on the Western shore of lake Xolotian. I stopped on the road from Esteli and took a photo of the great view of the mountains in the distance that I got in this part of Nicaragua.

I stopped about an hour further down the road to have a look at a river and as I did so I saw a guy on a bike with a huge parcel of stuff on the back. This is typical of how the people in Central America use their small bikes for, on one occasion whilst I was in Honduras I passed a guy who was carrying a 10 foot ladder over his shoulder whilst riding. All very surreal.

I got to the city of Granada at about 2 o'clock in the afternoon and once in my hotel which I paid 780 Cordobas (21 US Dollars) I wandered around the place for a while.

I found the place to be very clean and it had a very relaxing atmosphere to it. This place is a smaller, nicer, less touristy version of Antigua Guatemala and it is a place that I would recommend to anyone visiting Nicaragua.

I returned to my hotel and attended to the usual stuff and sort out my documents as I panned to cross the border from Nicaragua in to Costa Rica the following morning.
