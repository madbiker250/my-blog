# Impressions of Cartagena

On my way in to Cartagena I had to ride through the city at around four o'clock in the afternoon and as one can imagine it was chaos. Where I was staying was close to the old fortress that is the major landmark and tourist attraction for the city but this area is also at the Northernmost part of the city so I had to ride through the length of the entire city to get to it.

However, now that I did not need to ride the bike I walked from the place where I was staying in to the old town. This area reminded me a little of the Casco Viejo area of Panama City but it was much larger and much nicer. The whole area is enclosed by the old fortress walls along which I was able to walk to get an elevated view of the place. The walls are not particullarly high at around tweleve to fifteen feet.

I entered the area via a small door and tunnel in the walls and I found it to be full of bars, restaurants, tourist tat shops, designer clothing shops, and everything else that one would expect to find in an area that caters for the tourist. I also strolled along the narrow streets taking photographs as I went.

It was all very nice but it was way too touristy for my tastes so I then decided to walk further along the sea front to the Bocagrande area. Appaerently this area was only recently constructed and was designed to be built to first world standards having such things as proper sanitation, services such as undergorund electrical cables, and gated and guarded appartment block complexes. As I approached it I could not help but see a similarity between it and the skyline of Panama City.

As I was walking to Bocagrande I saw some local fishermen pulling in a net with their catch of the day. So I sat and watched as they pulled the net from the sea.

As they pulled the fish from the sea a squadron of pelicans were in attendance and were trying to pluck some of the fish from the net. There were also some frigate birds that were swooping down above the fishermen hoping to get at the fish that were flopping around on the sand.

 Once in the Bocagrande area I sat at a small restaurant on the beach and had a plate of grilled beef and two beers for 24,000 Pesos, around 5 USD. I then wandered around and found a very nice cafe with comfortable seats that were located outside and in the shade. I had a couple of coffees and smoked a cigar as I watched the tourists wander about looking at Google maps on their phones trying to find their way about, oblivious to a couple of locals who were watching them. Now I am not saying that these locals were theives but the fact that they were foucusing on the tourists made me more than a little suspicious, old habits die hard right enough! I then made my way back to my accommodation for the night and settled in behind the bars for another night.
