# Day 150

Due to the insane traffic in Lima I decided to get an early start to my day to see if I could avoid the worst of it so I left my hotel early at half past six in the morning however it was to no avail as the roads were already full of traffic. It took me over an hour to get out of the city and once I had ridden for about 30 miles or so I stopped to refuel and to have a coffee. I had put another layer on just in case I encountered the sea mist and shortly after I set off again I rode in to it. It did not clear till around ten o'clock.

The road again ran through coastal dessert terrain past lots of beach resorts but because of the sea mist there was not much to photograph. However at least there was only a gentle breeze coming off of the sea so I could make reasonable progress. It was all Autopista for the first 200 miles then back to single carriageway roads and desert bordered by mountains. After I reached the town of Paracas the road headed inland and I hit the city of Ica just before noon and the traffic there was also quite bad.

Once I reached the other side of Ica the road became much quieter and the ride much more pleasurable. After about an hour of riding on long straigh roads the road then climbed inland over the mountains and then it descended in to a valley the bottom of which was full of vegetation. This was the first time that I had seen crops being grown on a large scale since I had entered Peru.

Then it was through the town of Santa Cruz and out of the valley and back in to more dessert bordered by more mountains. By early afternoon I passed the site of the Nasca Lines, the huge pictures that were drawn on the desert by who knows who. Obviously from the road nothing can be seen so there was little point in stopping. Shortly thereafter I reached the actual city of Nasca where I decided to stop for the night having ridden almost 300 miles by that point.

I found a nice hotel for 68 Soles (about 18 USD) for the night which had both secure parking and hot showers in the rooms.

The hotel even had a roof terrace from where I had some really good views of the city and the surrounding mountains the tallest of which was covered in sand at the very top.
