# Day 150

Due to the insane traffic in Lima I decided to get an early start to my day to see if I could avoid the worst of it so I left my hotel early at half past six in the morning however it was to no avail as the roads were already full of traffic. It took me over an hour to get out of the city and once I had ridden for about 30 miles or so I stopped to refuel and to have a coffee. I had put another layer on just in case I encountered the sea mist and shortly after I set off again I rode in to it. It did not clear till around ten o'clock.

The road again ran through coastal dessert terrain past lots of beach resorts but because of the sea mist there was not much to photograph. However at least there was only a gentle breeze coming off of the sea so I could make reasonable progress. It was all Autopista for the first 200 miles then back to single carriageway roads and desert bordered by mountains. After I reached the town of Paracas the road headed inland and I hit the city of Ica just before noon and the traffic there was also quite bad.

Once I reached the other side of Ica the road became much quieter and the ride much more pleasurable. After about an hour of riding on long straigh roads the road then climbed inland over the mountains and then it descended in to a valley the bottom of which was full of vegetation. This was the first time that I had seen crops being grown on a large scale since I had entered Peru.

Then it was through the town of Santa Cruz and out of the valley and back in to more dessert bordered by more mountains. By early afternoon I passed the site of the Nasca Lines, the huge pictures that were drawn on the desert by who knows who. Obviously from the road nothing can be seen so there was little point in stopping. Shortly thereafter I reached the actual city of Nasca where I decided to stop for the night having ridden almost 300 miles by that point.

I found a nice hotel for 68 Soles (about 18 USD) for the night which had both secure parking and hot showers in the rooms.

The hotel even had a roof terrace from where I had some really good views of the city and the surrounding mountains the tallest of which was covered in sand at the very top.

# Day 151

Another day of riding largely empty roads through dessert landscapes began at just after eight o'clock in the morning. It was warm and sunny when I set off but once I stated heading towards the coast the temperature dropped a little but not enough for me to stop to put on extra clothes however the strong side winds reappeared. The road then continually rose and fell as it hugged the Pacific coast however at some points the road was cut in to the side of the mountains that ran down to the sea.

The main issue with this was that except for the bends there were no Armco barriers to prevent a vehicle going over the edge and plummeting hundreds of feet in to the sea. As I was negotiating these elevated road I had the occasional moment when the bike was blown about a strong gust of wind.

I was happy once the road returned to sea level when next to the coast as it was a lot safer given the strong winds. However by this time the sun had gone and it was overcast which dropped the temperature even more.

After having ridden for over 300 miles I finally arrived at my destination for the night in the town of Mollendo. I stopped at the first place that I saw and got a room with hot shower for 100 Soles (about 25 USD) for the night. The place was nice enough but a little overpriced however it had secure parking which sold it to me.

As usual after getting sorted out I headed out to explore the town and get something to eat taking photographs as I went.

The place that I had chosen to eat in had an elevated terrace which gave me a great view over the beach which was still full at around five o'clock in the evening but that may have been because the sun had come back out.

Everywhere in South America people with children or just children on their own walk about with baskets full of sweet things trying to get everyone to buy some. Whilst I was eating two children came in and asked if I wanted to buy some but I did not. However I thought that they each had a toy white rabbit for sale until I saw them move. I don't know if the rabbits were for sale but I gave them 4 Soles to pose for a picture.
