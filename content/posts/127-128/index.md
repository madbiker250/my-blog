# Day 127

After spending 2 nights at ny accommodation in Santa Ana it was time to leave. Due to having to return to Panama to attend to some personal business, I have had to cut my Central America trip short. Now having no time to visit Mexico, it was time to start heading South towards Panama but not before taking another couple of days to explore El Salvador.

I left Santa Ana at about 9 'o'clock in the morning heading generally South, and an hour later I had stopped for a coffee high above lake Coatepeque. The view was great except for the heat haze that restricted it somewhat.

I got back on the bike and headed South past the town of Sonsonate and then turned East on to road CA-12 that runs parallel with the Pacific coastline. The road had about 4 tunnels on it and although they are relatively short, they are unlit.

It was difficult to get a clear view of the coast due to thick roadside vegetation or the houses that were built with a great sea view, but on the occasions that I did catch a glimpse it was stunning. I stopped at a roadside cafe, perched on a cliff, that had great views of the ocean and beach below. I ordered a couple of coffees, I smoked a black market cigar that I had purchased in Santa Ana, and I sat absorbing the view for over an hour.

I had planned to stay in San Salvador for a night but my friend Manuel, the owner of the hostel in Santa Ana, advised me not to bother as it was too overcrowded and there was not much to see or do there. Instead he recommended that I head for the town of Suchitot, North of the capital city, that sits on the South shore of a large lake formed by the Rio Largo.

So after finishing my coffees and cigar I set off for Suchitoto but to get there I had to drive through San Salvador. It was nuts! The city is quite big and it was full choked with traffic, the area near the centre where all the photogenic buildings are was being dug up so I gave that a miss and headed out of the city. Despite not stopping, it took me over an hour to get through the city and out the other side.

Fortunately Suchitoto was only about an hour's ride from San Salvador and by 3 o'clock I had reached my accommodation for the night, a small hostel that I got for 21 US Dollars for the night. Again it was very nice as I was the only guest, so I had the place to myself, and it had secure parking for the bike (guard dog included!)

Then I did my usual thing of exploring the town and taking a few photos of the place. Although the town was not very big it was very nice and very clean. The town's street are all made of old cobbles which made for an interesting ride on my bike with it's knobbly tyres.

# Day 128

My friend Miguel from the hostel had told me that there was a ferry crossing from Suchitoto to the other side of the lake so I had decided to take that as opposed to riding all the way around it by road. once I was packed i headed down from the town on a very steep cobbled road and eventually found myself at the edge of the lake. There was no actual car park or dock, just a bit of the lake shore where the ferry would dock against.
