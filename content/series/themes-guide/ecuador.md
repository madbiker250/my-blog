The speed limits in Ecuador are 40 km/h (25 mph) or 60 km/h (37 mph) in built up areas, outside built up areas all roads are limited to 90 km/h (56 mph)

All of the road signs for the main roads are Green with White writing and the local roads are also Green with White writing. 

The main roads in Ecuador are either tarmac or concrete and they are all very good and reasonably well maintained. There are older stretches of roads in the the more remote areas of the country and the condition of these can be patchy. Most of the roads in Ecuador are toll roads and every one that I used cost me the same price of 20 US Cents.

Petrol at the time of writing was about 75 US cents per litre and it is sold in US gallons.

Ecuador does not have a high police presence on the roads and I never saw a police speed trap or a patrolling police car looking for speeding vehicles. The police cars are white and blue.

To buy a SIM card in Ecuador you just go to any shop with the mobile phone network sign outside it. The vendor will activate the sim card and I paid about 5 US Dollars for 10 days and 3 GB of internet.

I was unable to buy vehicle insurance at the border.
