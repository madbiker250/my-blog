The speed limits are as you can see in the picture that I took from the internet as like when I entered Spain, I somehow never managed to get a picture of them.

The motorways are numbered and prefixed with the letter A. Some of the motorways or stretches of a motorway are toll roads but most are not. The main non-motorway roads are also just numbered, and the smaller main roads are also just numbered.

The motorways signs have a Blue background with the number in Red/White, the main road signs have a Green background with the number in Red/White, signs for the smaller roads are also on a Green background but the road number is in Yellow/Black.

The smaller roads are generally in much poorer states of repair than in other European countries, however the other roads are generally good.

There are some speed cameras and there are a lot partolling police cars on the motorways. The police also operate lots of speed traps from patrolling police cars parked at the side of the road on both main and smaller roads.

The Poland does not use the Euro but petrol was generally much cheaper than any country that uses the Euro and at the time of writing was the equivalent of 0.90 Euros per litre.
