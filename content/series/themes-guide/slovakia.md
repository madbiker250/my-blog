The speed limits are as you can see in the picture that I took at the Polish/Slovakian border.

The motorways are numbered. All of the motorways are toll roads. The main non-motorway roads are also just numbered, and the smaller main roads are also just numbered.

The motorways signs have a Blue background, the main road signs have a Green background, signs for the smaller roads are on a Dark Blue background.

The smaller roads are generally in much poorer states of repair than in other European countries, however the other roads are generally good.

I never saw any patrolling police cars and I never saw any speed cameras.

Petrol was generally much cheaper than most countiries that use the Euro and at the time of writing was 1.30 Euros per litre.
