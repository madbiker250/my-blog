The speed limits are as you can see in the picture that I took from the internet.

In Croatia the motorways are numbered and prefixed with the letter A, the non motoway main roads are numbered, the smaller roads have the name of the place that the road lead to on them.

The Croatian motorways and the non motorway main roads that I rode on are of a good standard, the condition of the smaller roads are generally good but there is always the odd exception.

Like most countires in the Blakans, the motorways signs have a Green background with White numbers for the motorway number, the non motorway main road signs have a Blue background with White numbers, and signs for the smaller roads have a Yellow background with Black names.

At the time of writing Croatia do not use the Euro butn that will soon change, petrol at the time of writing was the equivalent of about 1.40 Euros per litre. 

I never saw any signs speed cameras nor any patrolling police vehicles.

My personal experince of biking in Croatia was limited to the North of the contry above Zadar. Again like Montenegro the coast road is very scenic but heavilly congested with slow moving tourist traffic.
