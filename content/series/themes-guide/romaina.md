The speed limits are as you can see in the picture that I took from the internet.

In Romania the motorways A roads, the non motoway main roads are just numbered and the smaller roads just have numbers.

I never rode on the motorways and the non motorway main roads in Romaina that I rode on are of a good standard. The smaller roads were not maintained to the same standard.

The A road motorways signs have a Green background with White numbers, the non motorway main road signs have a Blue background with Red/White numbers, and signs for the smaller roads have a Blue background with White numbers.

Romania does not use the Euro and Petrol at the time of writing it was about the equivalent of 1.30 Euros per litre.

I never saw any signs for speed cameras and I never saw any patrolling police vehicles.

Romaina has lots of great biking roads but my favourites are in the Transylvanian region.
