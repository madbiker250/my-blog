The speed limits are as you can see in the picture that I again took from the internet as like when I entered Spain, I somehow never managed to get a picture of them.

The motorways are are just numbered and although they are toll roads they are free for motorbikes, the main non-motorway roads are also just numbered, and the smaller main roads just have road names.

The motorways signs are in Green, the main road signs are in Blue, and signs for the smaller roads are white.

The samller roads are generally in much poorer states of repair than in other European countries, however the others are generally good.

I never saw any speed cameras and partolling police cars I only saw on the motorways once or twice during my time in the country.

The Czech Republic does not use the Euro but petrol was generally cheaper than Germany and at the time of writing was the equivalent of 1.30 Euros per litre.
