The speed limits are as you can see in the picture that I took from the internet.

In Greece the motorways are just numbered, the non motoway main roads are just numbered and the smaller roads just have the names of the town that they lead to on the signs.

The Greek motorways and the non motorway main roads that I rode on are of a good standard, however service stations were few and far between. The condition of the smaller roads are generally good but there is always the odd exception.

The motorways signs have a Green background with White numbers, the non motorway main road signs have a Blue background with White numbers, and signs for the smaller roads have a White background with Black names.

Petrol at the time of writing it was about 1.70 Euros per litre.

I never saw any signs for speed cameras and I never saw any patrolling police vehicles.

Greece has lots of great biking roads but my favourites are in the Peleponnese penisula which it to the South West of Athens.
