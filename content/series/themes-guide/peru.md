The speed limits in Peru are 40 km/h (25 mph) or 60 km/h (37 mph) in built up areas, outside built up areas all roads are limited to 80 km/h (56 mph) and 100 km/h on the Autopistas.

All of the road signs for the main roads are Green with White writing and the local roads are also Green with White writing. 

The main roads in Peru are either tarmac or concrete and they are most good and reasonably well maintained. There are older stretches of roads and the condition of these can be patchy. Most of the roads in Peru are toll roads abut like Colombia and Ecuador they all have a small lane to the side of the toll booths for bikes to pass without payment.

Petrol at the time of writing was about 85 US cents per litre and it is sold in US gallons.

Peru does not have a high police presence on the roads and I never saw a police speed trap or a patrolling police car looking for speeding vehicles. The police cars are white and green.

To buy a SIM card in Peru you just go to any shop with the mobile phone network sign outside it. The vendor will activate the sim card and I paid about 5 US Dollars for 10 days and 10 GB of internet.

I was unable to buy vehicle insurance at the border.
