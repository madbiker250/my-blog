The speed limits are as you can see in the picture that I again took from the internet as like when I entered Spain, I somehow never managed to get a picture of them.

The motorways are are called Autobahns and are just numbered. They are also toll free. The non-motorway main roads are also just numbered, and the smaller roads just have road names.

Cerain parts of the Autobahns have no speed limit and when driving on these roads it is very important to take great care when overtaking a slower moving vehicle as some other vehicle may be approaching you at extremely high speed. The best advice that I can give is once you decide to overtake make sure nothing is coming up fast behind you and then once you have made your ovetake get back in to the inside lane as quicly as possible.

The motorways signs are in Blue, the main road signs are in Yellow, and signs for the smaller roads are white.

All of the roads in Germany are very well mainatained.

Therre are a lot of speed cameras and partolling police cars everywhere in Germany.

Petrol was generally 20 cents more expensive per litre on the Autobahns and at the time of writing the cost elsewhere was 1.60 per litre.
