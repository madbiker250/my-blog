The speed limits in Spain are 50 km/h (50 mph) in built up areas, 90 km/h (56 mph) outside built up areas, and 130 km/h (86 mph) on motorways.

Like France, the motorways are the A roads, the main non-motorway roads are the N roads, and the smaller main roads are the C roads.

The motorways are all of a high standard but some are toll roads and some are not. The toll motorways are the AP numbered motorways and the non-toll motorways are the A numbered motorways.

The motorways signs are in Blue, the N road signs are in Red, and signs for the smaller roads are white.

Like France, Spain is also a huge country and most of the other roads are well maintained, again in Spain my personal favourites are the N roads, the old main National routes before the motorways were built and if I can, I use these in preference to the motorways.

Petrol is usually about 20 cents per litre more expensive on the motorways than on the other roads and at the time of writing it was about 1.40 Euros per litre.

Spain has speed cameras however they are generally good enough to warn you of them in advance, so when you see a sign for a speed camera on the road that you are on, generally there will be one within a few kilometres from the sign.

A major difference in Spain is encountered when negotiating roundabouts. The law in Spain is that the vehicle that is in the inside lane (the one nearest to the footpath) has right of way. In effect this means that the vehicle in the inside lane can go around the roundabout and go back in the way that it came from and all vehicles that are to the  outside of that vehicle (ones nearest the centre of the roundabout) must stop and give way to the vehicle to their right. 

In practice on small roundabouts that only have 1 lane this is not a problem, however, on roundabouts with 2 or more lanes this can be a problem if you are not aware of this law.

There are many great biking roads in Spain but one of my favourite roads is the N 120 that runs between Logrono and Vigo.
