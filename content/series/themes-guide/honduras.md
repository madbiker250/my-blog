The speed limits in Honduras are 40 km/h (25 mph) or 60 km/h (37 mph) in built up areas, outside built up areas all roads are limited to 80 km/h (50 mph)

All of the road signs for the main roads are Green with White writing and the local roads are White with Black writing. 

The main roads in Honduras are either tarmac or concrete and they are all generally good and reasonably well maintained. There are also some long stretches of gravel roads in the the more remote areas of the country. 

Petrol at the time of writing was about 1.20 US Dollars per litre. 

Honduras has a very small police presence on the road and I never saw a police speed trap or a patrolling police car looking for speeding vehicles. However, like Panama there are frequent police and military checkpoints on most of the major roads.

To buy a SIM card for a mobile phone you need to go to any shop that has the Tigo or Claro mobile phone network sign outside it. I bought a SIM card at the border for 10 US Dollars (250 Lempira in local currency) and that gave me 5GB of data for 7 days. No ID is required to buy a SIM card. The card can be topped up at any shop with the relevant sign outside it. 

No rvehicle insurance was required for me to enter Honduras. The TIP was issued to me for 50 US Dollars for 30 days but I think I got ripped off by a couple of "Helpers" at the border who did it for me. Nothing else is required but when you leave Honduras you must cancel your TIP, it can not be suspended and you need to get a new one if your return to Honduras.
